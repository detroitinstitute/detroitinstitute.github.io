	<description><![CDATA[Saying "the suburbs are the symbol of a life of boredom" is a matter of personal opinion for Detroitologist. You can't interpret that statement as "matter of fact." It's only a symbol of boredom for the socialite which primarily consists of young adults. I grew up in NYC and relocated to Pennsylvania as a pre teen. Yes I admit there is more for me in NYC then Pennsylvania as far as social, music, & dining events are concerned. There are a lot of people who have had enough of the trashy collectivist attitude of the obnoxious coffee shop liberal, union worker, and punk kids with their hat on sideways that you are going to find in the city. 

Detroit could be a great city if they had a mayor running it instead of a degenerate drug induced Marxist. They should let paxahau.com run the city. It seems like they're the only organization that knows how to get people from all around the world to spend their hard earned dollars in this poor city that was once so great and has now been desecrated from "collective rights", "corporate taxation", and lets not forget he big one we call "entitlement"! 

I'd move to Detroit if there were jobs. Hell...even Axel Foley left Detroit for Beverly Hills. ]]></description>
