	<description><![CDATA[Ah yes, he did the Electro EP under the cron name as well. I forgot that was on 21/22. I actually missed out on getting it until just a few years back.

Mr. Ed Luna was kind enough to bring me a copy when I threw a party in Hamilton With Todd, Ed and Charles Noel. Ele_mental was in the house!]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[You're talking about the 21/22 with that M/C/Jones track on it called "Gleek" right?

And the record shop you mention....I forget the name, but Titonton worked there for a spell and it was located in the Short North right???

I was in Columbus just 2 weeks ago ;)

I play at the Beatscape music fest there on the 30th as well!]]></description>
