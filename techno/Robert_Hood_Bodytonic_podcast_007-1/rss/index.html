	<description><![CDATA[tracklist fella....certainly the track that mixes into the "if you have a lighter in your pocket" track is a remix of Dave Clark's classic 'Red 2' which was initially on bush records but dunno bout the remix. There's also 'Steve Pointdexter's "work that motherfucker" which you'll be able to identify i reckon...don't know the others i'm afraid but they are class!]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Wow. This is seriously good shit. Seriously. 
Awesome don't even come close.
Techno at it's purest and most sublime & with an edge you could use to split atoms and break hearts.

Starkly austere yet with a deep, lush, frankly slightly disturbing emotion grip.

This is as good as it gets. Ever.
 
Grateful thanks to everyone involved in making this available. Congratulations on the quality.
