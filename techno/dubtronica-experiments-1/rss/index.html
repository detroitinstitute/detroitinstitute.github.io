<title>Detroit Institute of Techno - Dubtronica Experiments</title>
<link>http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/dubtronica-experiments-1/</link>
<description>Dubtronica consists of electronic beats played in a downbeat manner. It is much lower in speed than techno and generally warmer than dance-oriented electronica. The genre is repetitive but rewards careful listener attention. Some tracks use reggae toasters or singers to produce a more accessible form of the music.</description>
