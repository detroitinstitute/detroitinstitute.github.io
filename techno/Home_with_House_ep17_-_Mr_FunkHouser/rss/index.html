<title>Detroit Institute of Techno - Home with House ep17 - Mr. FunkHouser</title>
<link>http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Home_with_House_ep17_-_Mr_FunkHouser/</link>
<description>Last month's Home with House episode had a mellow late night groove, but this month's mix is much more energetic. Similar to episode 10, this mix is all about the funk. Jackin, pumping and upbeat funky house. Episode 17 has a fun and playful vibe and so it also has an appropriately fun name: Mr. FunkHouser. There isn't much more to say about it than that. So give'er a listen and I hope you enjoy!...</description>
