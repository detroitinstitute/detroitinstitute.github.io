No second attempts, no re-edits and no processing of the tracks after they were recorded. Add mastering by Matt Colton and you have one of the rawest techno EPs in recent memory.<br /><br />As with A Is For Acid the first pressing of this 12' will be on clear vinyl with a full colour double-sided artwork insert by Jonny Costello, who previously designed Perc's 'Wicker & Steel' album and 'Labour Division' by Forward Strategy Group.<br /><br />His new EP will hit the stores on the 28-08-2013 ! Keep your eyes on it ......... ]]></description>

	<title><![CDATA[Steve Bicknell - Addicted Podcast #16]]></title>
	<link>http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/steve-bicknell-addicted-podcast-16/</link>
  <source url="https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Faddicted_kiev%2Fsteve-bicknell-addicted"><![CDATA[Steve Bicknell - Addicted Podcast #16]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i48.tinypic.com/2duw674.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />Steve Bicknell was one of the first people we tried to reach out to with a podcast request. Not only were we amazed by the musical side of things that seemed to be a perfect match with what we wanted our series to turn out to be in the end, but we were also struck with the ethos behind Bicknell’s charismatic figure. He is co-running the LOST club night which is being heralded as the most influential and respected techno event in UK, not to mention it being the most long-running one. With the likes of Juan Atkins, Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Basic Channel and so on making their [arguably] most memorable appearances in Britain while hosted by LOST, the event itself has been successfully operating for more than 20 years. With big pleasure we present to you the podcast that took us 15 months to arrange and was definitely worth waiting so long.<br /><br />-	You have been running Lost events for 20+ years. For those who haven’t had a chance to attend any of those, how would you describe the event’s main features? What marks out Lost among many quality regular club nights London is famous for and has made it so influential for lots of techno personalities?<br />-	LOST is run by Sheree Rashit and myself, the parties are very minimal in the way of a dark room, excellent sound, nothing should distract from the music. The whole night is programmed on a production level in the same vein as a theatre performance, we had been running parties before Lost but my sound was heading deeper and deeper into the world of techno which many people at the time did not understand, i.e early UR, R&S, Djax etc obviously before that there was Transmat, Metroplex, KMS, etc..... But UR was taking a diffierent path, it was decided we would create an invronment for this sound to be heard. <br />Around the same time there was a night, Knowledge which was held on a Wednesday run by Jane Howard, Colin Faver and Colin Dale. Knowledge took place in a club, this is probably the closet night to Lost at the time, we (LOST) wanted to create the environment rather than holding the night in a club using a clubs sound system and lighting. We looked for spaces to hold LOST where we could take full control and create the environment, the first two parties were held in a photographers studio, the second being closed at 2:30am by the police. From that moment we had to make sure all licensing was in place, we found another space in Brixton (The Vox) which had a small club in the basement with three empty rooms above it , perfect ...... This is really where LOST was formed, running monthly nights at that time.<br /><br />-	Although Lost is known to be the pioneering event within UK techno scene, there must have been something to appear as an influence for it. What parties were you attending prior to starting Lost and what finally made you put efforts into having your own event?<br />-	As i mentioned previously, I'd pop by Knowledge, Heaven on a Friday and Trade, all were playing Techno but a slightly different sound to LOST, these nights were leaning more towards the Belgium sound, Trade was an after hours party with Daz Saund and Trevor Rockcliffe, I would go to Trade sometimes after playing.<br /><br />-	Apart from last year’s remix you did for Hauschka, you’ve been on a production hiatus for quite a while – word on the street is this will change soon. Can you please shed some light on this if possible?<br />-	In the interim I produced music for theatre projects and documentaries, I also remixed Plastikman last year, Richie Hawtin is responsible for getting me back into the studio, Richie asked me to produce a remix for the Plastikman Arkives release, my studio was in pieces, I produced the remix in a friend’s living room, On completion I realised that I had been missing the process of producing music for the dancefloor and decided to set up my studio, yes i took a break from producing music, longer than expected. I stopped producing music as i was just not enjoying producing anymore, there was a shift in the sound that i really did not like. Techno was becoming a production factory in business and sound, distributors would be planning the release shedule which meant meeting deadlines for productions, this was never my take on producing, I found myself sitting in the studio thinking I have to get this EP finished today, this was so far removed from my rational of making music, I was not enjoying producing music to deadlines so i stopped, plus as i mentioned the sound of Techno was changing and becoming more of a noise than music with no feeling or spirit. I was playing a lot in Europe at the time, sometimes i felt like I was playing R&B as the Techno a lot of others were playing was very harsh in sound and BPM, this was not for me.<br /><br />-	On a cover of the podcast we have a photo of you playing records while sitting on the floor. Apparently, this one was taken at the Lost event with Jeff Mills, am I right?<br />-	Yes, correct, this was the night of The Sleeper Wakes, held at LOST.<br /><br />-	How did it feel like to DJ this way? Can you please tell the original story behind this photo for those who might not have heard it before?<br />-	How did it feel? Mmmmm much better than i had anticipated and really right for me personally at the time, as I wanted to present Techno on another level, very deep and hypnotic. Sitting on the floor playing really cemented this sound, it was almost like sitting at home playing records with friends ...................... The original story is simple, we were at the location during the day setting up, Jeff was sound checking and making sure all was ok with the projections, the production guys were setting up the area for me to play, with that Jeff ask me "Hey Steve would you play on the floor?" my answer yes, why not. And actually I preferred it, I've never been very comfortable standing in front of an audience.<br /><br />-	Describe your mix for Addicted podcast. It’s a big honor for us to have you in the series – we would like to know the idea of this mix.<br />-	I almost described the mix above, actually this mix would fit into the concept of sitting rather than standing, it is a pure techno, the sound of the LOST dancefloor, hopefully deep and hypnotic ....................................... oooohhh .......... I should mention the next LOST is Easter Sunday 31st March, Jeff will be presenting Something In The Sky : Taken....... also myself, Moritz Von Oswald and Plaid, info: www.lost.co.uk<br /><br /> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/15ezki1.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />RYC Podcast 009 | Raffaele Attanasio (Napels)<br /><br />Raffaele Attanasio was born in a family of musicians. He cultivated a passion for music since he has been a child, infact he started to have piano lessons. At the age of 12 he started to take ones first steps in the world of djing and after 5 years he made his first productions. In this period he was really into techno music, electronic music and classical-contemporary composition. In 2007 he took the piano graduation which improves his artistic language. Raffaele Attanasio is a pianist, arranger and producer. During his career he collaborated with artists such as Orlando Voorn for the personal compilation on Nightvision Records. Now he is supported by important artists such as Len Faki, Luke Slater, Ben Sims, Kirk Degiorgio, Chris Liebing, Marcel Dettmann, Ben Klock, Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Oscar mulero and Dustin Zahn. Raffaele made remixes for Trapez, Gynoid and the last is called Telrae for Reimut Van Bonn. At the moment his success Black Bloc Ep (NON 001, 2011) is on charts. It's the first output on the spanish label. It's about a work made up of solid and snare techno groove. It's also going to come out the remixes version (NON002, 2012). The artist has choosen Italy as his home. Raffaele wishes one day the public will be less xenofile because it should be proud of italians talents and don't make them live the "Bel Paese". European artists should be less envious of italians.<br />Raffaele Attanasio is the proof of italians success. ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2hwnyfa.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />The plateaus of dense electrical fields foster the creative insurgency that’s necessary to occupy the attention of the worlds musical soldiers and the correspondence you’d exchange with yourself would dissolve into an acknowledgment of attachment.  It’s these audible depth charges that rattle your consciousness and in turn give you a fresh vista on your own progress, something our guest this week incites facilely.  He’s still harvesting the success of last year’s release ‘Shaman’s Path’ and rightly so – it was one of the albums of the year for us.  During the course of the production sequence which has facilitated the furtherance on Prologue, he’s maintained a heavy club and festival schedule across Europe.<br /><br />We dropped the touring confirmation at the start of the month – Dino Sabatini will be commencing his assault on Australia in March.  We’re lining up the first show in Brisbane with the White Rhino crew.  Anomaly in Sydney are fronting up the following night at One22 and closing the tour will be Billion Underground’s showing on March 08 in Melbourne.  This addition to the mix series is an apt sequel to an evolving saga – the rolling drugged electronica mirrors the events that will transpire.<br /> ]]></description>

  <source url="http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Feisengrau%2Fgiorgio-gigli-live-dommune-tokyo-24-5-2012%2F"><![CDATA[Giorgio Gigli LIVE @ Dommune - Tokyo 24-5-2012]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://d1lolb6yyp8wyu.cloudfront.net/w/300/h/300/q/85/upload/images/extaudio/daf78def-faea-41ac-8111-821f15efd8bc.jpeg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />After a deep exploration of several kinds of electronic dance music, in a broad evolutionary path, Giorgio Gigli's music has assumed an intense and personal form of communication.<br />The modules emerging from his compositions run across a process where moods are transformed into waves, layers and substrates that are ready to catch and overwhelm the listener without changing original content.<br />His skill is to transmit an accurate signal using undiscovered frequencies inspired by desolate and noir tinged landscapes. Giorgio transforms his material. Voids, pitfalls, drones and dilated melodies become intricate, sophisticated, and hypnotic rhythmic equipment that runs the risk of constantly changing classicist techno aesthetics in a conceptual derivation close to his soul. Giorgio loves ambient music that dues to its descriptive power allows him to analyze and render every vibration and vision, both during production and his long dj sets, where he explores empty rooms that are filled with vintage recordings, ethereal drones and field sonority. This particular working method is also reflected in his harder sets, where rhythm increases tension while it is moving forward unchallenged through industrial echoes, robotic tricks and building grooves that produce shaped variations of his meaning. Substance thickens to provide a thoughtful and reflexive listening experience. All these elements are poured into his project "Zooloft Records", a platform in constant update and in constant assimilation between old-school ethics (strongly linked to vinyl usage) and futuristic sounds which owe much to the futurist aesthetics of sixties sci-fi movies.<br />Zooloft is the materialization of a precise idea through a precise message: We Still Try ! ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/l2rezl">http://www.sendspace.com/file/l2rezl</a><br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/694/rataap.png/" target="_blank"><img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/6735/rataap.th.png" border="0"/></a><br /><br />Ernesto,  has been in the electronic music scene for almost a decade now. At the beginning of his career, after being a guitar enthusiast for many years during his teenage highscholl-college years , started to get interested in electronic music, this was thanks to bands and producers  such as The Prodigy, Depeche Mode, Fatboy Slim, Cassius, and many others, and in later years producers that actually made him evolve and understand techno such as Mars Volta, James Holden, Gabriel Ananda, Dominik Eulberg, John Dahlback, and many others.  This was a new way of life for Ernesto, sounds and beats, were basically a new wave of music in America and mostly Latin America  .  So he started to teach himself how to mix on beats,  how to use turntables and cd players.  At a very quick pace Ernesto started getting noticed by his Techno Minimal sessions in different  local clubs of El Salvador, over the next 2 years, started recording his sets as demos and started getting noticed out to  the local and international promoters market,  got the attention of many promoters that wanted some new fresh beats, so Ernesto  started to get more involved in the electronic scene in the  Central American and South American countries, getting his sets and gigs posted on many electronic music websites, such as Detroit Institute of Techno, blogs, online radios, and interviews regarding his achievements, with local and regional Radios shows, live and broadcasts(Guatemala, Panama, Honduras)  started getting much more recognition for his accomplishments as a electronic music dj/producer.<br />Ernesto has been involved with many electronic music sessions all over his region, such as Guatemala city, that sponsored the biggest international electronic music festival in Central America , Rave Del Castillo in 2008, with over 50 international DJs form all over the world, and still the biggest in the region. Since 2007 until today Guatemala and El Salvador have been the local scenarios for Ernesto, being invited many times to local clubs and raves. Also having presentations in Tegucigalpa, Honduras with local and international DJs. Using Traktor Scratch Pro 2 and/or Ableton live<br /> ]]></description>
