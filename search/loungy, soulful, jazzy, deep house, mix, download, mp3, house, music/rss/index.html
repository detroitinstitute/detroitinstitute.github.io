	<description><![CDATA[October's <a href="http://www.homewithhouse.com">Home with House</a> episode is finally here. This month's mix is a loungy ride suitable for listening to while hanging around the house or perhaps when having a dinner party. It contains equal parts soulful, funky, jazzy, and deep house all while maintaining that lounging vibe. There are moments of relaxed groove, some upbeat and funky sections and a few deeper tracks to keep things interesting.<br /><br />This mix is a bit unusual for the Home with House podcast series because it has broken away from the 1 or 2 hour mix target. I originally intended to make this a single hour mix but I ran over that time because I was in the flow of the mix. It also happened to fall short of the 2 hour mark because I didn't feel like shoe-horning songs in to stretch it out. So this mix is truly a result of just following the flow. I hope you enjoy episode 23, this one is called "The House that Lounge Built".<br /><br /><img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh23_thumb.jpg" border="0"><br /><br />"The House that Lounge Built" tracklisting:<br /><br />1.

	<description><![CDATA[I've been listening to a lot of Mark Farina's Mushroom Jazz CDs lately, especially volumes 4, 5 and 6. So it should be no surprise that this month's Home with House episode is strongly influenced by those mixes. This episode is still strictly house music, but it definitely has a more chilled and loungy vibe to it. I've entitled episode 19 "Just Be" because of its laissez-faire mood and relaxed energy. I hope you enjoy the mellow groove. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh19_thumb.jpg" border="0"><br /><br />"Just Be" tracklisting:<br />1. Joe Rizla - Donna Di Mondo (Dub Pass Mix)<br />2. Jon Cutler feat. E-man - It's Yours (Frankie Feliciano's Reconstruction Mix)<br />3. Tamara Wellons - Oh Well (Bahsonik Beats Mix)<br />4. Joey Youngman - My First Love (Original Mix)<br />5. Abstract Jazz Lounge 2 - Straight Magic (Wamdue Kids Jazz Mix)<br />6. Aya - Sean (Eric's 2WFU)<br />7.
