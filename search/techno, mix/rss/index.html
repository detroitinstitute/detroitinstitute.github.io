	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i48.tinypic.com/2duw674.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />Steve Bicknell was one of the first people we tried to reach out to with a podcast request. Not only were we amazed by the musical side of things that seemed to be a perfect match with what we wanted our series to turn out to be in the end, but we were also struck with the ethos behind Bicknell’s charismatic figure. He is co-running the LOST club night which is being heralded as the most influential and respected techno event in UK, not to mention it being the most long-running one. With the likes of Juan Atkins, Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Basic Channel and so on making their [arguably] most memorable appearances in Britain while hosted by LOST, the event itself has been successfully operating for more than 20 years. With big pleasure we present to you the podcast that took us 15 months to arrange and was definitely worth waiting so long.<br /><br />-	You have been running Lost events for 20+ years. For those who haven’t had a chance to attend any of those, how would you describe the event’s main features? What marks out Lost among many quality regular club nights London is famous for and has made it so influential for lots of techno personalities?<br />-	LOST is run by Sheree Rashit and myself, the parties are very minimal in the way of a dark room, excellent sound, nothing should distract from the music. The whole night is programmed on a production level in the same vein as a theatre performance, we had been running parties before Lost but my sound was heading deeper and deeper into the world of techno which many people at the time did not understand, i.e early UR, R&S, Djax etc obviously before that there was Transmat, Metroplex, KMS, etc..... But UR was taking a diffierent path, it was decided we would create an invronment for this sound to be heard. <br />Around the same time there was a night, Knowledge which was held on a Wednesday run by Jane Howard, Colin Faver and Colin Dale. Knowledge took place in a club, this is probably the closet night to Lost at the time, we (LOST) wanted to create the environment rather than holding the night in a club using a clubs sound system and lighting. We looked for spaces to hold LOST where we could take full control and create the environment, the first two parties were held in a photographers studio, the second being closed at 2:30am by the police. From that moment we had to make sure all licensing was in place, we found another space in Brixton (The Vox) which had a small club in the basement with three empty rooms above it , perfect ...... This is really where LOST was formed, running monthly nights at that time.<br /><br />-	Although Lost is known to be the pioneering event within UK techno scene, there must have been something to appear as an influence for it. What parties were you attending prior to starting Lost and what finally made you put efforts into having your own event?<br />-	As i mentioned previously, I'd pop by Knowledge, Heaven on a Friday and Trade, all were playing Techno but a slightly different sound to LOST, these nights were leaning more towards the Belgium sound, Trade was an after hours party with Daz Saund and Trevor Rockcliffe, I would go to Trade sometimes after playing.<br /><br />-	Apart from last year’s remix you did for Hauschka, you’ve been on a production hiatus for quite a while – word on the street is this will change soon. Can you please shed some light on this if possible?<br />-	In the interim I produced music for theatre projects and documentaries, I also remixed Plastikman last year, Richie Hawtin is responsible for getting me back into the studio, Richie asked me to produce a remix for the Plastikman Arkives release, my studio was in pieces, I produced the remix in a friend’s living room, On completion I realised that I had been missing the process of producing music for the dancefloor and decided to set up my studio, yes i took a break from producing music, longer than expected. I stopped producing music as i was just not enjoying producing anymore, there was a shift in the sound that i really did not like. Techno was becoming a production factory in business and sound, distributors would be planning the release shedule which meant meeting deadlines for productions, this was never my take on producing, I found myself sitting in the studio thinking I have to get this EP finished today, this was so far removed from my rational of making music, I was not enjoying producing music to deadlines so i stopped, plus as i mentioned the sound of Techno was changing and becoming more of a noise than music with no feeling or spirit. I was playing a lot in Europe at the time, sometimes i felt like I was playing R&B as the Techno a lot of others were playing was very harsh in sound and BPM, this was not for me.<br /><br />-	On a cover of the podcast we have a photo of you playing records while sitting on the floor. Apparently, this one was taken at the Lost event with Jeff Mills, am I right?<br />-	Yes, correct, this was the night of The Sleeper Wakes, held at LOST.<br /><br />-	How did it feel like to DJ this way? Can you please tell the original story behind this photo for those who might not have heard it before?<br />-	How did it feel? Mmmmm much better than i had anticipated and really right for me personally at the time, as I wanted to present Techno on another level, very deep and hypnotic. Sitting on the floor playing really cemented this sound, it was almost like sitting at home playing records with friends ...................... The original story is simple, we were at the location during the day setting up, Jeff was sound checking and making sure all was ok with the projections, the production guys were setting up the area for me to play, with that Jeff ask me "Hey Steve would you play on the floor?" my answer yes, why not. And actually I preferred it, I've never been very comfortable standing in front of an audience.<br /><br />-	Describe your mix for Addicted podcast. It’s a big honor for us to have you in the series – we would like to know the idea of this mix.<br />-	I almost described the mix above, actually this mix would fit into the concept of sitting rather than standing, it is a pure techno, the sound of the LOST dancefloor, hopefully deep and hypnotic ....................................... oooohhh .......... I should mention the next LOST is Easter Sunday 31st March, Jeff will be presenting Something In The Sky : Taken....... also myself, Moritz Von Oswald and Plaid, info: www.lost.co.uk<br /><br /> ]]></description>

At the beginning of his career, after being a guitar enthusiast for many years during his teenage highscholl-college years , started to get interested in electronic music, this was thanks to bands and producers  such as The Prodigy, Depeche Mode, Fatboy Slim, Cassius, and many others, and in later years producers that actually made him evolve and understand techno such as Mars Volta, James Holden, Gabriel Ananda, Dominik Eulberg, John Dahlback, and many others.  This was a new way of life for Ernesto, sounds and beats, were basically a new wave of music in America and mostly Latin America  .  So he started to teach himself how to mix on beats,  how to use turntables and cd players.  At a very quick pace Ernesto started getting noticed by his Techno Minimal sessions in different  local clubs of El Salvador, over the next 2 years, started recording his sets as demos and started getting noticed out to  the local and international promoters market,  got the attention of many promoters that wanted some new fresh beats, so Ernesto  started to get more involved in the electronic scene in the  Central American and South American countries, getting his sets and gigs posted on many electronic music websites, such as Detroit Institute of Techno, blogs, online radios, and interviews regarding his achievements, with local and regional Radios shows, live and broadcasts(Guatemala, Panama, Honduras)  started getting much more recognition for his accomplishments as a electronic music dj/producer.<br />Ernesto has been involved with many electronic music sessions all over his region, such as Guatemala city, that sponsored the biggest international electronic music festival in Central America , Rave Del Castillo in 2008, with over 50 international DJs form all over the world, and still the biggest in the region. Since 2007 until today Guatemala and El Salvador have been the local scenarios for Ernesto, being invited many times to local clubs and raves. Also having presentations in Tegucigalpa, Honduras with local and international DJs. Using Traktor Scratch Pro 2 and/or Ableton live<br /> ]]></description>

BC/RS have been one of my biggest influences in both techno and the listening process. to let the sound take over the senses and have those excursions of air be the only stimuli is an indulgence that needs to be experienced by everyone.  In my opinion, Morwitz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus were a head of the game.  They were, not only, big influences to detroit/techno artists (such as carl craig, richie hawtin, monolake, kevin saunderson, maurizio, villalobos, deep chord, echochord, etc.); the "shenanigans" done by this german-based label outfit also influenced and helped introduce the audio components and aesthetics now heard in contemporary, experimental sonic outputs from mates on the other side of the pond like, the bug (techno animal), shackleton, peverlist, pinch, appleblim, 2562, burial, deadbeat, and pole, to name a few.  innovators on their own plane..  I present 52mixtape012 to the people of Basic Channel.  <br />  <br />tracks were taking from numerous Basic Channel and Rhythm and Sound albums and eps including other tracks and remixes by monolake, carl craig, paperclip people, sleeparchive and richie hawtin.<br /><br />respect,<br />m. ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[ATOMIC-JAM <br />Saturday 20th March - 9.30PM-6.00AM <br />Q-Club <br />Corporation Street, Birmingham <br /><br />Atomic Jam returns to the Q Club for one of only two planned spectacular shows at this venue in 2010. Luke Slater, one of UK's true electronic music & techno pioneers, presents his Planetary Assault Systems live show. As well as running his own label Mote-evolver, 2009 saw the release of the new and much awaited PAS album on Ostgut Ton in Berlin, again changing the Techno landscape to much praise from fans and industry alike. Frequency 7, a soundclash of styles from Ben Sims and Surgeon, performing together creating a uniquely improvised experience combining elements of techno, funk, dub, house, hip-hop, disco, industrial etc. utilizing turntables, CD decks, FX & all the latest Hardware/Software technology. Redshape's sound sits somewhere between everything in dance music and Redshape's very own imagination. It's not minimal, not maximal and always historically respecting the vibe of Detroit. Repetition is something Redshape works hard to prevent, his live shows morph & develop everytime to never play the same show twice. Residential duties fall to the much talented Mark Broom & Chris Finke, who both have a wealth of releases, remixes and collabs to keep your eyes on this year <br /><br />MAIN ARENA: <br />LUKE SLATER (Planetary Assault Systems LIVE) <br />FREQUENCY 7 (Ben Sims & Surgeon) <br />REDSHAPE live <br />MARK BROOM <br />CHRIS FINKE <br /><br />ROOM TWO: DRUM & BASS / <br />BREAKTHRU VS GRINDHOUSE <br />CALYX <br />PHASE II <br />DAN B <br />PACE <br />REACTION <br />DJ X <br /><br />ROOM THREE: ELECTRO, UK-BASS, RAVEBEATS / <br />RESONANT ALLIANCE <br />The RA collective unite for further sonic experimentation and we're very excited to welcome, from The Hague in Holland, Mr Pauli and DJ Overdose. Two legends of the Dutch electro scene, with links to I-F and releases on the seminal labels Viewlexx, Murder Capital and Bunker, the pair will be performing live followed by DJ Overdose dropping an old-skool electro set.
