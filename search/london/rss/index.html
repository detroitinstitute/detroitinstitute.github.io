No second attempts, no re-edits and no processing of the tracks after they were recorded. Add mastering by Matt Colton and you have one of the rawest techno EPs in recent memory.<br /><br />As with A Is For Acid the first pressing of this 12' will be on clear vinyl with a full colour double-sided artwork insert by Jonny Costello, who previously designed Perc's 'Wicker & Steel' album and 'Labour Division' by Forward Strategy Group.<br /><br />His new EP will hit the stores on the 28-08-2013 ! Keep your eyes on it ......... ]]></description>

  <source url="https%3A%2F%2Fsoundcloud.com%2Faddicted_kiev%2Fsteve-bicknell-addicted"><![CDATA[Steve Bicknell - Addicted Podcast #16]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i48.tinypic.com/2duw674.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />Steve Bicknell was one of the first people we tried to reach out to with a podcast request. Not only were we amazed by the musical side of things that seemed to be a perfect match with what we wanted our series to turn out to be in the end, but we were also struck with the ethos behind Bicknell’s charismatic figure. He is co-running the LOST club night which is being heralded as the most influential and respected techno event in UK, not to mention it being the most long-running one. With the likes of Juan Atkins, Richie Hawtin, Jeff Mills, Basic Channel and so on making their [arguably] most memorable appearances in Britain while hosted by LOST, the event itself has been successfully operating for more than 20 years. With big pleasure we present to you the podcast that took us 15 months to arrange and was definitely worth waiting so long.<br /><br />-	You have been running Lost events for 20+ years. For those who haven’t had a chance to attend any of those, how would you describe the event’s main features? What marks out Lost among many quality regular club nights London is famous for and has made it so influential for lots of techno personalities?<br />-	LOST is run by Sheree Rashit and myself, the parties are very minimal in the way of a dark room, excellent sound, nothing should distract from the music. The whole night is programmed on a production level in the same vein as a theatre performance, we had been running parties before Lost but my sound was heading deeper and deeper into the world of techno which many people at the time did not understand, i.e early UR, R&S, Djax etc obviously before that there was Transmat, Metroplex, KMS, etc..... But UR was taking a diffierent path, it was decided we would create an invronment for this sound to be heard. <br />Around the same time there was a night, Knowledge which was held on a Wednesday run by Jane Howard, Colin Faver and Colin Dale. Knowledge took place in a club, this is probably the closet night to Lost at the time, we (LOST) wanted to create the environment rather than holding the night in a club using a clubs sound system and lighting. We looked for spaces to hold LOST where we could take full control and create the environment, the first two parties were held in a photographers studio, the second being closed at 2:30am by the police. From that moment we had to make sure all licensing was in place, we found another space in Brixton (The Vox) which had a small club in the basement with three empty rooms above it , perfect ...... This is really where LOST was formed, running monthly nights at that time.<br /><br />-	Although Lost is known to be the pioneering event within UK techno scene, there must have been something to appear as an influence for it. What parties were you attending prior to starting Lost and what finally made you put efforts into having your own event?<br />-	As i mentioned previously, I'd pop by Knowledge, Heaven on a Friday and Trade, all were playing Techno but a slightly different sound to LOST, these nights were leaning more towards the Belgium sound, Trade was an after hours party with Daz Saund and Trevor Rockcliffe, I would go to Trade sometimes after playing.<br /><br />-	Apart from last year’s remix you did for Hauschka, you’ve been on a production hiatus for quite a while – word on the street is this will change soon. Can you please shed some light on this if possible?<br />-	In the interim I produced music for theatre projects and documentaries, I also remixed Plastikman last year, Richie Hawtin is responsible for getting me back into the studio, Richie asked me to produce a remix for the Plastikman Arkives release, my studio was in pieces, I produced the remix in a friend’s living room, On completion I realised that I had been missing the process of producing music for the dancefloor and decided to set up my studio, yes i took a break from producing music, longer than expected. I stopped producing music as i was just not enjoying producing anymore, there was a shift in the sound that i really did not like. Techno was becoming a production factory in business and sound, distributors would be planning the release shedule which meant meeting deadlines for productions, this was never my take on producing, I found myself sitting in the studio thinking I have to get this EP finished today, this was so far removed from my rational of making music, I was not enjoying producing music to deadlines so i stopped, plus as i mentioned the sound of Techno was changing and becoming more of a noise than music with no feeling or spirit. I was playing a lot in Europe at the time, sometimes i felt like I was playing R&B as the Techno a lot of others were playing was very harsh in sound and BPM, this was not for me.<br /><br />-	On a cover of the podcast we have a photo of you playing records while sitting on the floor. Apparently, this one was taken at the Lost event with Jeff Mills, am I right?<br />-	Yes, correct, this was the night of The Sleeper Wakes, held at LOST.<br /><br />-	How did it feel like to DJ this way? Can you please tell the original story behind this photo for those who might not have heard it before?<br />-	How did it feel? Mmmmm much better than i had anticipated and really right for me personally at the time, as I wanted to present Techno on another level, very deep and hypnotic. Sitting on the floor playing really cemented this sound, it was almost like sitting at home playing records with friends ...................... The original story is simple, we were at the location during the day setting up, Jeff was sound checking and making sure all was ok with the projections, the production guys were setting up the area for me to play, with that Jeff ask me "Hey Steve would you play on the floor?" my answer yes, why not. And actually I preferred it, I've never been very comfortable standing in front of an audience.<br /><br />-	Describe your mix for Addicted podcast. It’s a big honor for us to have you in the series – we would like to know the idea of this mix.<br />-	I almost described the mix above, actually this mix would fit into the concept of sitting rather than standing, it is a pure techno, the sound of the LOST dancefloor, hopefully deep and hypnotic ....................................... oooohhh .......... I should mention the next LOST is Easter Sunday 31st March, Jeff will be presenting Something In The Sky : Taken....... also myself, Moritz Von Oswald and Plaid, info: www.lost.co.uk<br /><br /> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[After a few months off, Noodle return with the phattest line up to date. <br />Bring on the bass! <br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />Noodle with Warlock & Sir Real <br />Saturday 13th June <br /><br />Warlock (Rag & Bone Records) <br />Sir Real ([k]rack-troni[k] / House of God) <br />Craig Sylvester <br />Ally Reilly <br />Mark Allen <br />Matt Hinton <br /><br />8pm-4am <br /><br />Moog, Newdigate Street, Nottingham NG7 4FD <br /><br />FREE ENTRY as always! <br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />A DJ refusing to be sucked into any one genre, a typical Warlock set is a new experience every time. <br /><br />A spontaneous mash up of all things dark and bass heavy but above all, big tunes. Expect anything from the contemporary flavas of dubstep, electro, breaks and 4x4 to old skool hardcore, acid house and techno. <br /><br />Beginning his days on legendary London pirate Pulse FM, Warlock was a regular feature on the rave circuit, resident at Labrynth, Helter Skelter and up and down the country playing the likes of The Eclipse, Elevation, Interdance and Universe. <br /><br />He then became a part of the early London techno scene and would often be found spinning at Knowledge, Eurobeat 2000 and many of the early squat parties put on by Spiral Tribe and Bedlam. <br /><br />Today, together with Noyeahno, he runs the uncompromising Rag & Bone label which aside from their own releases has seen cult material being unleashed by the likes of Aaron Spectre, Drop The Lime, King Cannibal, Kanji Kinetic and Blackmass Plastics. <br /><br />Expect dirty dancefloor business all the way. <br /><br />Sir Real (Neil Spragg) has been involved in the music scene in Birmingham, UK for more than 20 years as a drummer, producer and label-owner, and for the last fifteen years, following an eye-opening visit to Holland, he has been an integral part of the Midlands club scene and is one of the three original resident DJs (alongside Surgeon & Paul 'Damage' Bailey) from notorious Birmingham club House of God, one of the longest running techno clubs in the UK (it recently celebrated its 15th birthday!). Sir Real has DJ'd and played live extensively around the UK, as well as in clubs across Europe, and in Japan. He is also a prolific producer, and released several well-received EPs on the now-defunct Round Records (which he helped set up in 1997). He has his own label Snafu Recordings, and helps run Covert Records with DJ Bigfoot. <br /><br />Most recently energy has been directed towards [k]racktroni[k], which focuses on broken elektro funk. He has also recorded tracks for Satamile, Ant-Zen/Hymen, Psy-Harmonics, Domino, Embryo Records, Magic Trax, and Melt Recordings and has had several tracks licensed to high profile compilations (including Dave Clarke's hugely successful World Service electro-techno mashup and Bentley Rhythm Ace's FSUK mix). <br />On top of all this he also manages to hold down a full-time job as head of sales at Veto Music Wholesale, a distribution company based in the Midlands, and still finds time to fit in the odd sound-design contract for various gaming companies in the UK. <br /><br />Noodle are excited to welcome him to Nottingham for a set of electro and party techno. Expect it to go off. <br /><br />See you on the dancefloor! <br /><br /><br /> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Resident Advisor RA.147 DJ Pete<br /><br />The Scion and Hard Wax man gets low on this week's RA podcast.<br /><br />Peter Kuschnereit is a man with some serious techno credentials. Not only has he worked for Berlin's much lauded Hard Wax record shop since 1991, he's also responsible for the first ever release on Basic Channel sub-label Chain Reaction as Scion alongside RenÃ© LÃ¶we (AKA Vainqueur). National service in concurrent periods forced the duo to produce solo, culminating for Kuschnereit in the release of his Session Elements album as Substance. But the Substance project was put on the backburner when Mark Ernestus and Moritz von Oswald decided that Scion were the right people to represent Basic Channel in the live arena, and the duo became early adopters of Ableton Live to create 2002's Scion Arrange and Process Basic Channel Tracks mix CD. <br /><br />Tracklisting:<br />01. Appleblim and Peverelist - Circling<br />02. Scuba - Ruptured (Surgeon remix)<br />03. Trolley Route - Tempura (Sterac Mix)<br />04. Mala - Bury Da Bwoy<br />05. Ben Klock - Before One<br />06. Jichael Mackson - Snuff<br />07. Burial - South London Boroughs<br />08. Tayo - March Of The Soundbwoyz (TRG Remix)<br />09. Aphrohead - In The Dark We Live (Dave Clarke's 312 Mix)<br />10. Loefah - Twisup Vip (Youngsta & Task Remix)<br />11. Redshape - Species<br />12. Shed - Solitude Straight<br />13. Scuba - Tense<br /><br /><a href="http://ra2.residentadvisor.net/audio/RA147_20090323_DJ-Pete-residentadvisor.net.mp3">Download mp3</a> ]]></description>
