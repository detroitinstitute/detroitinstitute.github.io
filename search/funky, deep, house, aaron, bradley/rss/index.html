	<description><![CDATA[There are few dj's who work as hard as Aaron Bradley to push their skills and take the art of dj'ing to he next level.<br /><br />With several highly popular mixes already released on TheFreshpage it was only natural to ask Aaron Bradley to create an exclusive mix for us. TheFreshpage Sessions 5 takes on a new twist shying away from electro house and brings you the warmth of funky deep house music. With that said you definitely need to prepare yourself for getting your freak on as the cover of this release is not the only thing that's going to give you tingles down your spine! Deep basslines carries the groove from the get go and transforms to the jazzy rhythms of Chuck Love's Learn to Love. But things get a little f-r-e-a-k-y with Peace Division's It's Here It's Now only to come back with the acid jazz flavour of the following tracks La thomberia and Hula Hula. But Aaron saves one of the best for the last part of the set, Joey Youngman's Heatwave Jackin which is so hot it might just heat up your ear lobes. With impeccable mixing and funky track after funky track Aaron Bradley sheds a new light on TheFreshpage Sessions. ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[If you like it funky and deep then Aaron Bradley has something for you! The Funky Deep End has a cool calm and collected feel perfect for the transition between spring and summer. With chill vocals like in Pimp and jazzy saxophone melodies in Do it Again you're going to have a hard time not letting loose of all of that daily tear and wear on your spirit. Tribal injected drumlines are interspersed wtih soulful vocals right up near the end with a standout track Crazy Times by Toka Project vs Da Sunlounge. ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[No one does it funky and deep like Aaron Bradley, and his unique spin on things shakes you buckwild with Rata Tat Tat - Funk That. Starting off with old school flavour Jack Aaron's spell slowly takes you over until right through with DJ Dan's Put the Record Back On! And the funk takes place, Just Bounce will do just that, make you bounce in your chair with it's sexy basslines. And it doesn't stop there as The Funkalizer EP shakes you up even more. All this quirkiness and not even half way through but wait until you hear the funkiness of Two's Up by Da Sunlounge - oooh BABY! ]]></description>
