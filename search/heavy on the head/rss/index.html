	<description><![CDATA[After a few months off, Noodle return with the phattest line up to date. <br />Bring on the bass! <br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />Noodle with Warlock & Sir Real <br />Saturday 13th June <br /><br />Warlock (Rag & Bone Records) <br />Sir Real ([k]rack-troni[k] / House of God) <br />Craig Sylvester <br />Ally Reilly <br />Mark Allen <br />Matt Hinton <br /><br />8pm-4am <br /><br />Moog, Newdigate Street, Nottingham NG7 4FD <br /><br />FREE ENTRY as always! <br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />A DJ refusing to be sucked into any one genre, a typical Warlock set is a new experience every time. <br /><br />A spontaneous mash up of all things dark and bass heavy but above all, big tunes. Expect anything from the contemporary flavas of dubstep, electro, breaks and 4x4 to old skool hardcore, acid house and techno. <br /><br />Beginning his days on legendary London pirate Pulse FM, Warlock was a regular feature on the rave circuit, resident at Labrynth, Helter Skelter and up and down the country playing the likes of The Eclipse, Elevation, Interdance and Universe. <br /><br />He then became a part of the early London techno scene and would often be found spinning at Knowledge, Eurobeat 2000 and many of the early squat parties put on by Spiral Tribe and Bedlam. <br /><br />Today, together with Noyeahno, he runs the uncompromising Rag & Bone label which aside from their own releases has seen cult material being unleashed by the likes of Aaron Spectre, Drop The Lime, King Cannibal, Kanji Kinetic and Blackmass Plastics. <br /><br />Expect dirty dancefloor business all the way. <br /><br />Sir Real (Neil Spragg) has been involved in the music scene in Birmingham, UK for more than 20 years as a drummer, producer and label-owner, and for the last fifteen years, following an eye-opening visit to Holland, he has been an integral part of the Midlands club scene and is one of the three original resident DJs (alongside Surgeon & Paul 'Damage' Bailey) from notorious Birmingham club House of God, one of the longest running techno clubs in the UK (it recently celebrated its 15th birthday!). Sir Real has DJ'd and played live extensively around the UK, as well as in clubs across Europe, and in Japan. He is also a prolific producer, and released several well-received EPs on the now-defunct Round Records (which he helped set up in 1997). He has his own label Snafu Recordings, and helps run Covert Records with DJ Bigfoot. <br /><br />Most recently energy has been directed towards [k]racktroni[k], which focuses on broken elektro funk. He has also recorded tracks for Satamile, Ant-Zen/Hymen, Psy-Harmonics, Domino, Embryo Records, Magic Trax, and Melt Recordings and has had several tracks licensed to high profile compilations (including Dave Clarke's hugely successful World Service electro-techno mashup and Bentley Rhythm Ace's FSUK mix). <br />On top of all this he also manages to hold down a full-time job as head of sales at Veto Music Wholesale, a distribution company based in the Midlands, and still finds time to fit in the odd sound-design contract for various gaming companies in the UK. <br /><br />Noodle are excited to welcome him to Nottingham for a set of electro and party techno. Expect it to go off. <br /><br />See you on the dancefloor! <br /><br /><br /> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[00:00] 00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />Edweird strikes again!<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Ed's site</a><br /><br />[01:00] 01 - TJR "I'm In The Pocket" Tonewrecker 13 [I'm In The Pocket EP 2007]<br /><br />I wont go on again about how I came to realize how much I like this track. For that you can refer to previous Bleeps. I will mention again that it'll probably be a long time before it leaves my bag so get used to hearing it. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/985947">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[05:33] 02 - Luke's Anger "Organ Monkey" Tigerbass 02 [Give Em Some Freq EP 2007]<br />Again I'm always going on about Luke's stuff. I've spoiled him enough. I'll relate a quick story instead. last Saturday my girlfriend and I went to the drive-in. Sitiing in the car, in line, waiting to pay, I was listening to this mix. At the point this track came on the car beside us gave us strange looks. I didn't say it was a good story...<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/945493">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[08:35] 03 - Sugar Experiment Station "Influence Technology" Scandinavia 03 [Ultimathule EP 1996]<br /><br />All four tracks on this EP should be drilled into people's head the very second they are born. Unless it's discovered that loud music is bad for newborns. I suspect it may be. it's classic in my circles and I suspect other's as well. Neil Landstrumm and Tobias Schmidt work together well now and seemingly always have. Although to be fair I didn't have to think that up myself. neil says so in his <a href="http://www.scandinavianyc.com/nickedidea.html">Archives</a><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/17554">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[11:50] 04 -  Tobias Schmidt "Systemshocker" Feinwerk 11 [Heavy Makeup EP 2007]<br />Another track, from another record, that wont be soon leaving the bag. Toby has been absolutely killing it the last few releases. he's always been someone I kept an eye out for, but it's reached a new level. It all started with the Monkey Tennis EP. Something changed. For the better.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/861897">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[15:48] 05 - Axel Sohns "Analog Komplex" Tonewrecker 11 [Circling The Wagons Ep 2006]<br /><br />I don't know if Axel has anything else lined up for release. I do know his label Kitty-Corner is putting out some killer releases though. I definitely urge everyone to check out the latest ep by TSR.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/883378">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[19:08] 06 - Lief Ryan "Da Shit!" Growth 02 [Unhealthy Living EP 2003]<br />I seem to have a strange relationship with Lief's stuff. I get it, love it, forget about it. Don't know why. Lately I've been digging back out and giving it the room to breathe and the playtime it deserves.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/213851">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[22:11] 07 - Rosie Brown "Bliss (D's Boom Bap Bleep Edition)" .dotbleep 11 [Bliss - Derrick Carter Remixes EP 2006]<br /><br />I firmly believe this track is being abused by myself. And yet I can't put it away. DC's magic touch has overwhelmed my senses with his cunning use of bleep and vocal!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/764184">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[26:40] 08 - Jamie Lidell "Freely Freekin" Mosquito 08 [Freekin The Frame EP 1997]<br />I've come to the conclusion that this is probably my favorite track. Most people start off sucking at least a little. jamie started off where most end up and has only gotten better since this record. Big up the TSR boys for hooking me up with this so I can have a 2nd copy. Not to hog it, but to be able to play the snot out of it without worrying about ruining my only copy!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/21253">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[29:58] 09 - Byron Stingily "Get Up! (Mousse T.'s Extended Mix)" Peppermint Jam [Get Up! Remixes EP 1996]<br /><br />This record is one of the few I catch myself singing along to. Brings me back to early party days and more specifically old Terry Mullan sets.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/50838">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[33:31] 10 - TSR "Robi Und Fredi" Don't 09 [Onion Tied To My Belt EP 2006]<br />I'm going to go out on a limb and say that only two of the TSR'ers were involved in this track. They finally got rid of that Tommy character!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/635266">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[36:07] 11 - Smash TV "Electronic Boy" Bpitch Control 20 [Rock On Boy Ep 2001]<br /><br />This was one of those songs that you hear out and go nuts trying to figure out what it was. I believe it was Mateo Murphy that finally id'd it for me that year. Via...the old Gtech mailing list. yes my memory is very selective, but quite often very good.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/39709">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[40:14] 12 - Luke's Anger "Strangle Hold" Don't 10 [Fistful Of Donkeys EP 2006]<br />Blah blah blah...see above. I do have this to say about the next Don't release though..."Readyyy now....." Sing it Frankie! ;) Tip!!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/722426">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[43:31] 13 - Subhead "Forest Friends" Subhead 02 [Forest Friends Ep 1996]<br /><br />Subhead of course being quite good at what they do did it again on the 2nd release of their own label. This is the track that most people buy it for if I do remember idle chat correctly. The release party for this EP was big news at the time and apparently was 5 shades of awesome. Subhead live and Claude Young when the music he played was still good? Yes please.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/54857">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[47:04] 14 - Tomas Nordstrom "Jagermiester" Don't 05 [Knights Of The Jager EP 2004]<br />This is a new addition to the bag, but it's been around the block. I made myself put it away for a while as I over played it big time when it first came out. I'm allowing myself to use it again. Sparingly. if I overdo it...suck it up.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/324535">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[50:22] 15 - Mark Hawkins "Frequency Respnose" Input-Output 15 [13 Years Of Raving EP 2007]<br /><br />Think of this as a teaser EP. It's not really. Not officially I don't think anyway. Mark's album worth of tracks that he WANTS A HOME FOR is all along the same vein as this ep. There's one difference....The LP is even better. It's got Bill Youngman and aLXe doing guest bits on it. Previews soon my pretties<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/912169">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[54:53] 16 - Cannibal Cooking Club "longpigchef (Bill Youngman Remix)" Cannibal Cooking Club 04 [Recooked Volume 1 EP 2005]<br />This is probably one of my favorite remixed tracks. Bill totally turned a decent CCC track into gold. A guy I work with who doesn't normally listen to anything electronic heard this on a cd I had. he was fist pumping within seconds. Uh..in the air.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/455990">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[57:32] 17 - Kylie Minogue "Slow (Tomas Nordstrom Feat. Chill Cover Version)" <br /><br />I had to include this track. I tossed it in at the very end as I believe it deserves a full play out. I wont bother telling you all just how much I love it. I'll let you decide for yourself just how damn catchy it is.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e69%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-26-2007.mp3">Download the July 26th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

The beat sets up<br />extreme pressure - deeply pumping! The introducing bass creates an nameless groove with<br />great harmonics.  A tiny squeaky synth behaves like a ball lightning and adds a particular<br />charm to the track. The producers are rolling out such an extraordinary carpet of sound that<br />the eight-minute arrangement is over too quick and you want to enjoy again and again. Great<br />track - full of emotion and warm atmosphere - far in the front and at home at any dance floor -<br />every time and everywhere!<br /><br />A2: Simplicity Always Wins"  You are going completely wrong if you would like to judge<br />the track from its name. You could think that the name is suitable in the beginning - hearing<br />the airy low-groove beat. Next step you get in touch with the constant bass and the forcing up<br />synths and effects and realize that the guys attached importance to extreme sonic quality.<br />A few elements merge and create a complex environment which you will listen in repeat mode until<br />you experienced every single bit. It's a ticket for a rich in content vacation at the Monoid universe!<br /><br />B1.: Meridian  B-Side surprise - extraordinary dance floor bomb.  Contrasts attract each<br />other - celebration par excellence! The beat pushes and agitates the feet on the dance floor.<br />The harmonic bass supported by the creamy and clear chords and ambience bursts the firm<br />atmosphere and you can hardly describe the created mood. This track provides a state of<br />emergency! Headbanger with strong emotions - must listen!<br /><br />B2.: Leaving is a special rounding up the broad range of moods on this EP. Tribal techno<br />meets tech-house - sounds easy  and housy but is pushing forward like techno.<br />Filtered guitar chords drip from the sweat-saturated ceiling. ]]></description>
