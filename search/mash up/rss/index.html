	<description><![CDATA[After a few months off, Noodle return with the phattest line up to date. <br />Bring on the bass! <br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />Noodle with Warlock & Sir Real <br />Saturday 13th June <br /><br />Warlock (Rag & Bone Records) <br />Sir Real ([k]rack-troni[k] / House of God) <br />Craig Sylvester <br />Ally Reilly <br />Mark Allen <br />Matt Hinton <br /><br />8pm-4am <br /><br />Moog, Newdigate Street, Nottingham NG7 4FD <br /><br />FREE ENTRY as always! <br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />A DJ refusing to be sucked into any one genre, a typical Warlock set is a new experience every time. <br /><br />A spontaneous mash up of all things dark and bass heavy but above all, big tunes. Expect anything from the contemporary flavas of dubstep, electro, breaks and 4x4 to old skool hardcore, acid house and techno. <br /><br />Beginning his days on legendary London pirate Pulse FM, Warlock was a regular feature on the rave circuit, resident at Labrynth, Helter Skelter and up and down the country playing the likes of The Eclipse, Elevation, Interdance and Universe. <br /><br />He then became a part of the early London techno scene and would often be found spinning at Knowledge, Eurobeat 2000 and many of the early squat parties put on by Spiral Tribe and Bedlam. <br /><br />Today, together with Noyeahno, he runs the uncompromising Rag & Bone label which aside from their own releases has seen cult material being unleashed by the likes of Aaron Spectre, Drop The Lime, King Cannibal, Kanji Kinetic and Blackmass Plastics. <br /><br />Expect dirty dancefloor business all the way. <br /><br />Sir Real (Neil Spragg) has been involved in the music scene in Birmingham, UK for more than 20 years as a drummer, producer and label-owner, and for the last fifteen years, following an eye-opening visit to Holland, he has been an integral part of the Midlands club scene and is one of the three original resident DJs (alongside Surgeon & Paul 'Damage' Bailey) from notorious Birmingham club House of God, one of the longest running techno clubs in the UK (it recently celebrated its 15th birthday!). Sir Real has DJ'd and played live extensively around the UK, as well as in clubs across Europe, and in Japan. He is also a prolific producer, and released several well-received EPs on the now-defunct Round Records (which he helped set up in 1997). He has his own label Snafu Recordings, and helps run Covert Records with DJ Bigfoot. <br /><br />Most recently energy has been directed towards [k]racktroni[k], which focuses on broken elektro funk. He has also recorded tracks for Satamile, Ant-Zen/Hymen, Psy-Harmonics, Domino, Embryo Records, Magic Trax, and Melt Recordings and has had several tracks licensed to high profile compilations (including Dave Clarke's hugely successful World Service electro-techno mashup and Bentley Rhythm Ace's FSUK mix). <br />On top of all this he also manages to hold down a full-time job as head of sales at Veto Music Wholesale, a distribution company based in the Midlands, and still finds time to fit in the odd sound-design contract for various gaming companies in the UK. <br /><br />Noodle are excited to welcome him to Nottingham for a set of electro and party techno. Expect it to go off. <br /><br />See you on the dancefloor! <br /><br /><br /> ]]></description>

UK Bass originator Paul Blackford is joined by some of the scenes future stars including fellow Bass Gun operator, Smashback and the Data Trace Records collective. <br /><br />Since it's inception over four years ago, Manchester's Electrode event has gone on to acclaim an international reputation as as the kind of event that offers fresh, cutting edge, dancefloor based electronic music with an atmosphere that most nights could only wish for. <br /><br />Their music policy draws on many elements including electro, techno, breakbeat, dubstep and acid. Past guests have included:- Si Begg, Tim Wright, Bill Youngman, Ardisson, Ade Fenton, Lief Ryan, Cynthia Stern, Cutlass Supreme, Sir Real, Dark Mode, Warlock, NoYeahNo and Stormfield to name but a few. <br /><br />The Noodle story is similar, coming into existence just over 2 years ago and quickly acquiring a reputation for quality underground beats. The only place in Nottingham that you can hear Detroit Electro-bass alongside Swedish wonkyness! Guests have included DMX Krew, Cynthia Stern, MLZ, Lief Ryan, Luke's Anger, Peter Mangalore, Spewis and Computer Controlled. <br /><br />With the more recent success of labels Data-Trace and Bass Gun, spawned off the back of Electrode and now holding their own amongst the most repected and <br />established labels around, the collective's reputation and respect continually grows. <br /><br />********************<br />coach travel from Nottingham.

  <source url="http%3A%2F%2F"><![CDATA[Resident Advisor RA.073 Deadbeat]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[Resident Advisor podcast number 73 from September 30, 2007 is a live set from Canadian dub techno producer Deadbeat, real name Scott Monteith, whose parents are a Reiki therapist, someone who claims to be able to heal people with energy even from a distance, and a church minister, someone who makes claims that are just as preposterous in order to control the minds of the crowd before him -- though it is a proven fact that DJs are able to do both such things quite well.  Influences of Basic Channel and Jamaican dub can be heard in this set which features a lot of ~scape and unreleased dancehall tunes.<br /><br />Tracklisting:<br />1. Fixed Elections (Dancehall mix) - unreleased<br />2. Refund Me (featuring Bubbz) - ~Scape<br />3. Where Has My Love Gone - ~Scape<br />4. Bad Man Mash Up - unreleased<br />5.

	<description><![CDATA[M.A.N.D.Y. - Dasding Plattenleger - September 1, 2007<br /><br />Patrick Bodmer and Philipp Jung have for years been making music that has what it takes to top European charts while still appealing to techno sensibilities.  From time to time they, as M.A.N.D.Y., team up with fellow Deutschlanders Booka Shade who share this similar style which leans towards disco-pop electro-house minimal-techno.  <br /><br />And so it goes on their set broadcast on Dasding Plattenleger, a weekly weekend radio show hosted by Stephan Hinz broadcast on FM in South Germany and over the internet.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/?d=ZVHRJBWF">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />We also have Oliver Huntemann on Dasding Plattenleger from back in February the 18th.  Oliver keeps making cameos on our site, such as with Stephen Bodzin, without getting his own proper post which will be happening soon.<br /><br />He even comes with a tracklisting:<br />1 - Oliver Huntemann - 51 Poland Street (Extrawelt remix)<br />2 - ID<br />3 - ID<br />4 - Xenia Beliaeva - Hellraiser<br />5 - Stephan Bodzin - Daytona Beach<br />6 - ID<br />7 - ID<br />8 - ID<br />9 - Spektre - Minimal Mashinist (Oliver Huntemann remix)<br />10 - Huggotron - Superkiller<br />11 - Jan Driver - L<br />12 - Rekorder 8.1<br />13 - ID<br />14 - ID<br /><br /><a href="http://www.gigasize.com/get.php/403441/Oliver_Huntemann__Live__Plattenleger_Dasding_18.02.2007.mp3">Download mp3 from gigasize</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[00:00] 00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />Edweird strikes again!<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Ed's site</a><br /><br />[01:00] 01 - TJR "I'm In The Pocket" Tonewrecker 13 [I'm In The Pocket EP 2007]<br /><br />I wont go on again about how I came to realize how much I like this track. For that you can refer to previous Bleeps. I will mention again that it'll probably be a long time before it leaves my bag so get used to hearing it. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/985947">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[05:33] 02 - Luke's Anger "Organ Monkey" Tigerbass 02 [Give Em Some Freq EP 2007]<br />Again I'm always going on about Luke's stuff. I've spoiled him enough. I'll relate a quick story instead. last Saturday my girlfriend and I went to the drive-in. Sitiing in the car, in line, waiting to pay, I was listening to this mix. At the point this track came on the car beside us gave us strange looks. I didn't say it was a good story...<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/945493">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[08:35] 03 - Sugar Experiment Station "Influence Technology" Scandinavia 03 [Ultimathule EP 1996]<br /><br />All four tracks on this EP should be drilled into people's head the very second they are born. Unless it's discovered that loud music is bad for newborns. I suspect it may be. it's classic in my circles and I suspect other's as well. Neil Landstrumm and Tobias Schmidt work together well now and seemingly always have. Although to be fair I didn't have to think that up myself. neil says so in his <a href="http://www.scandinavianyc.com/nickedidea.html">Archives</a><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/17554">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[11:50] 04 -  Tobias Schmidt "Systemshocker" Feinwerk 11 [Heavy Makeup EP 2007]<br />Another track, from another record, that wont be soon leaving the bag. Toby has been absolutely killing it the last few releases. he's always been someone I kept an eye out for, but it's reached a new level. It all started with the Monkey Tennis EP. Something changed. For the better.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/861897">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[15:48] 05 - Axel Sohns "Analog Komplex" Tonewrecker 11 [Circling The Wagons Ep 2006]<br /><br />I don't know if Axel has anything else lined up for release. I do know his label Kitty-Corner is putting out some killer releases though. I definitely urge everyone to check out the latest ep by TSR.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/883378">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[19:08] 06 - Lief Ryan "Da Shit!" Growth 02 [Unhealthy Living EP 2003]<br />I seem to have a strange relationship with Lief's stuff. I get it, love it, forget about it. Don't know why. Lately I've been digging back out and giving it the room to breathe and the playtime it deserves.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/213851">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[22:11] 07 - Rosie Brown "Bliss (D's Boom Bap Bleep Edition)" .dotbleep 11 [Bliss - Derrick Carter Remixes EP 2006]<br /><br />I firmly believe this track is being abused by myself. And yet I can't put it away. DC's magic touch has overwhelmed my senses with his cunning use of bleep and vocal!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/764184">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[26:40] 08 - Jamie Lidell "Freely Freekin" Mosquito 08 [Freekin The Frame EP 1997]<br />I've come to the conclusion that this is probably my favorite track. Most people start off sucking at least a little. jamie started off where most end up and has only gotten better since this record. Big up the TSR boys for hooking me up with this so I can have a 2nd copy. Not to hog it, but to be able to play the snot out of it without worrying about ruining my only copy!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/21253">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[29:58] 09 - Byron Stingily "Get Up! (Mousse T.'s Extended Mix)" Peppermint Jam [Get Up! Remixes EP 1996]<br /><br />This record is one of the few I catch myself singing along to. Brings me back to early party days and more specifically old Terry Mullan sets.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/50838">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[33:31] 10 - TSR "Robi Und Fredi" Don't 09 [Onion Tied To My Belt EP 2006]<br />I'm going to go out on a limb and say that only two of the TSR'ers were involved in this track. They finally got rid of that Tommy character!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/635266">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[36:07] 11 - Smash TV "Electronic Boy" Bpitch Control 20 [Rock On Boy Ep 2001]<br /><br />This was one of those songs that you hear out and go nuts trying to figure out what it was. I believe it was Mateo Murphy that finally id'd it for me that year. Via...the old Gtech mailing list. yes my memory is very selective, but quite often very good.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/39709">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[40:14] 12 - Luke's Anger "Strangle Hold" Don't 10 [Fistful Of Donkeys EP 2006]<br />Blah blah blah...see above. I do have this to say about the next Don't release though..."Readyyy now....." Sing it Frankie! ;) Tip!!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/722426">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[43:31] 13 - Subhead "Forest Friends" Subhead 02 [Forest Friends Ep 1996]<br /><br />Subhead of course being quite good at what they do did it again on the 2nd release of their own label. This is the track that most people buy it for if I do remember idle chat correctly. The release party for this EP was big news at the time and apparently was 5 shades of awesome. Subhead live and Claude Young when the music he played was still good? Yes please.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/54857">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[47:04] 14 - Tomas Nordstrom "Jagermiester" Don't 05 [Knights Of The Jager EP 2004]<br />This is a new addition to the bag, but it's been around the block. I made myself put it away for a while as I over played it big time when it first came out. I'm allowing myself to use it again. Sparingly. if I overdo it...suck it up.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/324535">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[50:22] 15 - Mark Hawkins "Frequency Respnose" Input-Output 15 [13 Years Of Raving EP 2007]<br /><br />Think of this as a teaser EP. It's not really. Not officially I don't think anyway. Mark's album worth of tracks that he WANTS A HOME FOR is all along the same vein as this ep. There's one difference....The LP is even better. It's got Bill Youngman and aLXe doing guest bits on it. Previews soon my pretties<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/912169">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[54:53] 16 - Cannibal Cooking Club "longpigchef (Bill Youngman Remix)" Cannibal Cooking Club 04 [Recooked Volume 1 EP 2005]<br />This is probably one of my favorite remixed tracks. Bill totally turned a decent CCC track into gold. A guy I work with who doesn't normally listen to anything electronic heard this on a cd I had. he was fist pumping within seconds. Uh..in the air.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/455990">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[57:32] 17 - Kylie Minogue "Slow (Tomas Nordstrom Feat. Chill Cover Version)" <br /><br />I had to include this track. I tossed it in at the very end as I believe it deserves a full play out. I wont bother telling you all just how much I love it. I'll let you decide for yourself just how damn catchy it is.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e69%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-26-2007.mp3">Download the July 26th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />When I say Bleep, you say yeaaaahhhhh!<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Edit's Web Site</a><br /><br />01 - Z-Bomb "Unknown" Bunker [Keepers Of The Cheese Ep 2007]<br />Along the lines of old Circuit Breaker and other such tastey stuff. This track is a stab at the heart of those who like their music clean and in it's place. No idea who this Z-Bomb cat is, but we all know what Bunker is. Or we should at any rate. They're currently in one of their runs of good music. Always have to take advantage of that when it happens.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/974792">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />02 - Fugo "System Overload" Neue Heimat 24 [Robots Engaged In Bondage EP]<br />Another great track off an EP I've been toting around a lot again. It's a slow burner, it catches your ear without you really catching it doing so. Neue heimat needs to step up the pace with it's releases. I choose to ignore the rumour of no more Neue Heimats until I hear it right from someone's mouth who at the very least holds the position of CEO or higher.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/265770">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />03 - Digital Princezz "Lazy Milk Man" Mutter 13 [The Owner Of Half The World EP 2001]<br />There is some controversy over who exactly DP is. I personally don't care. I do know that about half of what DP releases is some pretty pimpin Techno. I can live with that. I wasn't too huge a fan of the latest DP on Feinwerk. It's ok, but what that means is the next one will probably rock.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/47420">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />04 - Neil Landstrumm "Pussy Puppy" Tresor 170 [Glamourama EP 2001]<br />I think this EP had something to do with a video game..??? I'm probably wrong. I can't even remember where that silly nonsense crept into my head from. I can tell you with certainty that this whole record is a bad-ass record. As you can tell for yourself if you're here already in the set.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/7074">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />05 - TJR "I'm In The Pocket" Tonewrecker 13 [I'm In The Pocket EP 2007]<br />When I initially heard the track sample for this when the release was announced I wasn't keen on the TJR mix. I absolutely loved Paul Birken's, but this mix didn't sit well with me. Now that I have the record and I can hear it loud and clear and at full length...I can tell you it's awesome. One of those cross-genre songs I love so much. I'll be able to listen and or play this anywhere and it'll go over well with whomever.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/985947">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />06 - Luke's Anger "Yo Ass" Bowwow 05 [Dead Like Elvis Ep 2006]<br />This EP has future classic written all over it. Of course that's just me being cheeky with my markers, but it's for good reason. I can't even really describe the overall sound of the EP. it's got so much variety crammed into 4 tracks it should be made into the National Anthem for one of the smallish countries.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/679554">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />07  - Blackmass Plastics "Gatesmasher" Bowwow 06 [Quarantine Zone EP 2007]<br />Blackmass is a new found artist for me. Someone forgot to keep me in the loop a few years back for about 10 minutes and it resulted in me missing out on some gold. Big up the Uk badness this guy represents. I love it and want more.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/965772">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />08 - Fix "Dope Computer" KMS 43 [Flash EP 1992]<br />I think we all know this record. By ear at any rate. Now you know what it is, if you didn't already. Classic tune on the flip, but Dope Computer is just as good and doesn't get as much air time. Changed that!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/4649">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />09 - Smooky "Fresh (Feat. Nino-Fight, MC Coeld'r, Dj Idem)" Electronik Weed Crew 07 [Do You Remembmer Ep 2007]<br />A lot of nerds went on saying this EP wasn't as good as previous Smooky/EWC material. Sure it may be a change of pace for them, but if you want to get all nasty every time someone tries something a tad different than I suggest eating something long and cumbersome. Ho! It's great fun, who doesn't like Swedish Mc'ing on top of a Kool and the Gang's remix of "Fresh"? <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/981524">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />10 - Jacob London "The Casino Squirrels and Lounge Shooter" Utensil 19 [Droppin Squirrels EP 2007]<br />I actually played the wrong song on this EP, but I figured it was too late to turn back. It's still good of course. Anyone who's live-sets involve singing into a vocoder stuffed into a monkey's anus can't go too wrong.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/952351">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />11 - The Wee Djs "Kick it VIP" Combat Recordings 10 [Darkhorse Dubs Ep 2006]<br />Another Wee track. I'm a big Wee fan. The low end, whether it's distorted or not, is always done proper. The little extra squiggly bleeps are what do my head in though. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/837034">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />12 - Daze Maxim "Unknown" White<br />The one sheet that came with this has fallen out. I believe it's Serial killer's Haircut 31, but since the info has been lost I can't be sure. I should have markered it on like the rest I know. Ok. I'm 98% sure this is SKH 01. Confirmation so I can write it on the damn record already?<br /><br />13 - Blackmass Plastics "Freak House" Rag & Bone 11 [Four Aces Ep 2006]<br />Yadda Yadda BMP. Right after I heard the Bowwow Ep I did some digging for any other BMP I might like. The problem was I couldn't find one I didn't like and this was the only other one in stock. My eyes are peeled now.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/602564">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />14 - Jason Leach "Untitled" Input-Output 11 [Beateater EP 2005]<br />Cynthia Stern's label is currently one of my favorites. Top 5 for sure. It's likely to stay there for a while too. I could see him messing it all up by suddenly only releasing Germanic Polka mash-ups or something. Great label + Jason Leach = Holy trouser trout! The long chiptune/breabeat gem on the flip is what I usually play the snot out of, I thought I'd try this side out today. Sounds like I should have checked it out sooner.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/601281">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />15 - Youngman & Landstrumm "Double Bag It" Input-Output 09 [Destroyaz EP 2005]<br />The Destroyaz they call themselves when touring together and that's exactly what they do. A certified legend and another one in the making?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/384532">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />16 - Joy Division "She's Lost Control (Neil Landstrumm Cover Version)" Scandinavia 25 [Factory Revival Ep 2006]<br />When Neil takes hold of the reins and vocals are involved he seems to get better and better. I can't remember an instance of it not being awesome, but it improves every time as well. This one was a project that sat close to home for him, influential music from his early music beginnings.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/678334">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />17 - Caucasian Boy "Honey Dip (Prime Cutz Mix)" Strictly Rhythm 12201 [HoneyDip/Northern Lights EP 1993]<br />There's always room for acid. This is a bit of an oldie that may not sit well with some. I would even be tempted to say it's a bit of a light weight these days. I was in the mood for it though so what I can say?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/31561">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />18 - Lambda "Hold On Tight (Laidback Luke Remix)" La Maison Grande [Hold On Tight LP 1999]<br />I first heard the original mix of this played by Barry Weaver back in the 90's sometime. I didn't know what it was at the time, but it stuck in my head. I was thoroughly stoked when I was skimming through new releases one day and discovered not only what it was, but that it was also being repressed. I love those happy occurences!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/134603">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />19 - DadaBleep "Nikeshirts" RZ Music 20 [Nikeshirts EP 2007]<br />RZ rocks out again with another record that could have been written 15 years ago, but wasn't.A new take on the classic acid sound. Always welcome in my home. It reminds me of another record that was big about 2 years ago. And now for the life of me I can't remember just what the hell that other record is. I'll ponder some more...<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/988496">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e66%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-05-2007.mp3">Download the July 5th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[So it's Monday again.  Maybe you have the day off.  Maybe you just don't feel like doing work.  Either way you'd rather watch funny Internet videos than get deep into a techno set while adding a few bucks to the corporate bottom line.<br /><br />First is a clip from an old dance TV show in Detroit called The Scene.  The year is 1982 and the song they're dancing to is Sharevari by A Number of Names, considered by many to be the first techno track ever, considered by the rest to be a prototype of said genre, the two without which this site may have never existed.  Read BMG's take on the story behind it at <a href="http://www.metrotimes.com/editorial/story.asp?id=2691">Metro Times</a>.  <br /><br /><youtube>xhE-0IDpkiM</youtube><br /><br />Next up is one of the funniest videos of Detroit techno that has nothing to do with Detroit techno.<br /><br /><youtube>sPKRnj038yE</youtube><br /><br />Then we have Daren Ager demonstrating in his homemade commercial for the Korg EMX how to perform Detroit techno on this quite capable piece of kit.<br /><br /><youtube>bwzTpCGLchs</youtube><br /><br />Finally we have the video for Fedde Le Grand's European smash hit from last summer Put Your Hands Up For Detroit.  I realize this may be very old, that you may be very sick of hearing the song, but how can you ever tire of hot stripper nurses? Shout outs to Ghostly International for the original rendition of this song, way back in the day -- for those who know.<br /><br /><youtube>Mxa6s_ybjZo</youtube> ]]></description>
