	<description><![CDATA["As the birthplace of techno in the mid-Eighties, Detroit has a near-mythical status in dance music's history. Yet, ironically, its reputation as a nexus of sonic innovation is based largely on music committed to vinyl almost 20 years ago by a trio of artists whose status is now that of "living legends"." ]]></description>

  <source url=""><![CDATA[Tresor closing video and Richie Hawtin documentary]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[I found this <a href="http://symbiostic.de/downloads/TresorClosing_online.wmv">video of Richie Hawtin's set from Tresor's closing party</a> but then the <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Awakenings_10_Year_Anniversary_47-48/">Awakenings</a> <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Awakenings_10_Year_Anniversary_462007/">sets</a> took over for a few days.  It's about 20 minutes of a pretty good performance cutting between clean recording and live video audio and he's even wearing the "Magda Make the Tea" t-shirt that we <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Magda-at-Lobby-Colombia/">alluded </a> to before.  It seemed like it was much more a party mood compared to the last <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/One-last-FOCUS-Electronic-12-years-farewell-to-Alternative-Take/">Focus:Electronic</a>.  The club had a good run from 1991 to 2005 becoming one of the world's top techno clubs not to mention a fine record label.  The club was located in part of an old department store near the Berlin Wall with a steel vault inside from which came the name, tresor meaning "treasure" in French but in German means "safe" or "vault".  Though a drug raid at the club preceded its closing, economic pressure in the gentrifying neighborhood is what caused the block it sat on to be redeveloped as offices.  And so it goes.  Read the <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/news/Tresor_closing_letter/">closing letter from Tresor here</a>.<br /><br />I also recently watched the Slices's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPioneers-Electronic-Music-Vol-1%2Fdp%2FB000JUBBDQ%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Ddvd%26qid%3D1177017092%26sr%3D1-1&tag=detrinstoft06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Pioneers of Electronic Music Volume 1 DVD</a>,  which is basically a documentary about Richie Hawtin.  It contains lots of interview footage of <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Richie-Hawtin-at-Winter-Music-Conference/">Richie Hawtin</a>, <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Magda-at-Lobby-Colombia/">Magda</a>, <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/John_Acquaviva_April_podcast/">John Acquaviva</a>, the Hawtin family, <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Sven-Vath-Saturday/">Sven Vath</a><a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/One-last-FOCUS-Electronic-12-years-farewell-to-Alternative-Take/">Clark Warner</a>, Derrick May, and so many other important people in the Detroit techno scene.  Lots of footage from his early days in Detroit, the beginnings of Plus 8 Records, and lots of goodies and extras in general.  It's sure to become a classic in techno history if only because there are so few documentaries that tell the story right now, the other great new one being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHigh-Tech-Soul-Creation-Techno%2Fdp%2FB000GCFYOY%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1177017092%26sr%3D1-1&tag=detrinstoft06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">High Tech Soul</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPioneers-Electronic-Music-Vol-1%2Fdp%2FB000JUBBDQ%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Ddvd%26qid%3D1177017092%26sr%3D1-1&tag=detrinstoft06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325"> Purchase Pioneers of Electronic Music Volume 1 DVD here</a>.  <br /><br /><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=detrinstoft06-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> ]]></description>
