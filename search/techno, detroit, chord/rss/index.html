	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/15ezki1.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />RYC Podcast 009 | Raffaele Attanasio (Napels)<br /><br />Raffaele Attanasio was born in a family of musicians. He cultivated a passion for music since he has been a child, infact he started to have piano lessons. At the age of 12 he started to take ones first steps in the world of djing and after 5 years he made his first productions. In this period he was really into techno music, electronic music and classical-contemporary composition. In 2007 he took the piano graduation which improves his artistic language. Raffaele Attanasio is a pianist, arranger and producer. During his career he collaborated with artists such as Orlando Voorn for the personal compilation on Nightvision Records. Now he is supported by important artists such as Len Faki, Luke Slater, Ben Sims, Kirk Degiorgio, Chris Liebing, Marcel Dettmann, Ben Klock, Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Oscar mulero and Dustin Zahn. Raffaele made remixes for Trapez, Gynoid and the last is called Telrae for Reimut Van Bonn. At the moment his success Black Bloc Ep (NON 001, 2011) is on charts. It's the first output on the spanish label. It's about a work made up of solid and snare techno groove. It's also going to come out the remixes version (NON002, 2012). The artist has choosen Italy as his home. Raffaele wishes one day the public will be less xenofile because it should be proud of italians talents and don't make them live the "Bel Paese". European artists should be less envious of italians.<br />Raffaele Attanasio is the proof of italians success. ]]></description>

BC/RS have been one of my biggest influences in both techno and the listening process. to let the sound take over the senses and have those excursions of air be the only stimuli is an indulgence that needs to be experienced by everyone.  In my opinion, Morwitz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus were a head of the game.  They were, not only, big influences to detroit/techno artists (such as carl craig, richie hawtin, monolake, kevin saunderson, maurizio, villalobos, deep chord, echochord, etc.); the "shenanigans" done by this german-based label outfit also influenced and helped introduce the audio components and aesthetics now heard in contemporary, experimental sonic outputs from mates on the other side of the pond like, the bug (techno animal), shackleton, peverlist, pinch, appleblim, 2562, burial, deadbeat, and pole, to name a few.  innovators on their own plane..  I present 52mixtape012 to the people of Basic Channel.  <br />  <br />tracks were taking from numerous Basic Channel and Rhythm and Sound albums and eps including other tracks and remixes by monolake, carl craig, paperclip people, sleeparchive and richie hawtin.<br /><br />respect,<br />m. ]]></description>
