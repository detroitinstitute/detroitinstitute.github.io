	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.clr.net/images/news/370.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />CLR Podcast 233 – Giorgio Gigli<br /><br />It is Monday the 12th of August 2013 and today we have Giorgio Gigli back on the CLR Podcast. Since his first appearance in our podcast series the Italian DJ/producer has not only been busy playing out at numerous renowned international venues, but has also been working hard in the studio. The results can be heard in form of some excellent releases like the “INSIDE EP” which is out on Speedy J´s label Electric Deluxe, his collaboration with George Paar “Life Is Not Dead Yet”, out on Paar Wax or his upcoming joint venture with Obtane entitled “Perception Through Dissonance” (Rrose Remix), which will be released soon on Prosthetic Pressings. His multi-layered, intricate style is the result of an acute exploration of several kinds of electronic music and his personal evolutionary path as an artist has led to the liaison with one of the most respected Techno labels in the scene. Starting from 2011 the collaboration with Electric Deluxe has established an intense relationship ferrying his DJ set in a new dimension where it combines an industrial/dark approach with a solid stream of club-oriented Techno. If you would like to know more about Giorgio Gigli or his own imprint “Zooloft Records".<br /> ]]></description>

  <source url="http%3A%2F%2Fwww.clr.net%2Fmedia.pl"><![CDATA[CLR Podcast 212 – Carl Craig]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i47.tinypic.com/2iw4ker.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />It is Monday the 18th of March 2013 and we welcome one of the undisputed founding fathers of Detroit Techno for the first time on the CLR Podcast. This week´s set is by none other than the legendary Carl Craig, who has been continuously delivering genre-defining and visionary productions since his first release in 1989. He has been described as a creative visionary, a groundbreaking electronic music icon, an inspirational artist, an esteemed Grammy-nominated composer, a world-class DJ and an ambassador for his native Detroit. Yet the common thread that runs through Craig’s broad musical canon and creative projects is a resounding fascination with futurism. He has cultivated a unique path as an artist, entrepreneur and civic leader, guided by his tendency toward forward thinking. Craig helped launch the Detroit Electronic Music Festival (DEMF) in 2000 and has also created the non-profit 501-C3 Carl Craig Foundation, which supports young artists and helps to develop a new music scene that follows the legacy of his birthplace and current base Detroit. On Friday the 22nd of March he will play at CLR´s WMC nighttime event at Space Miami and the whole crew is very much looking forward to this memorable get-together of some of the finest artists in today´s Techno scene. If you would like to know more about Carl Craig, his upcoming gigs, releases and his influential label Planet-E, please visit the following sites: ]]></description>

He told me this is the first mix he's ever done that sounds like this, which I'm really happy with! Each artist is after all fully free to choose his or her musical direction!<br /><br />Speaking of Non-Series, Raffaele will release his first album on the label soon. I haven't heard previews yet, but am certainly keen to find out what it sounds like!<br /><br />The last saturday of June will feature a Non-Series special, with two podcasts: one from Psyk and one from Chevel. From now on, I will be uploading an extra podcast every last Saturday of the month.<br /><br />Also uploaded today is a techno podcast by Giorgio Gigli. Combined with this wonderful electronic podcast from Raffaele Attanasio a great and diverse weekend. Quality guarantueed! Enjoy!<br /><br />Check all Invite's Choice podcasts via: Invite's Choice Podcast section. ]]></description>

He's made a 61 minute trip that stays interesting from the first to last minute and doesn't bore at any time.<br />Often really deep sets have that effect on me as they're to flat, but not so for mr Gigli: he knows what he's doing!<br /><br />What else can I say about this man who has released records on Electric Deluxe, label of Dutch hero Speedy J and where I was fortunate enough to play at Timewarp Holland, Giorgio has played at the Italian edition!<br /><br />It's about time to get to the music; here's Giorgio Gigli's trip for Invite's Choice!<br /><br />Check all Invite's Choice podcasts via: Invite's Choice Podcast section.<br /><br />Next week my Choice will be: Raffaele Attanasio ]]></description>

He cultivated a passion for music since he has been a child, infact he started to have piano lessons. At the age of 12 he started to take ones first steps in the world of djing and after 5 years he made his first productions. In this period he was really into techno music, electronic music and classical-contemporary composition. In 2007 he took the piano graduation which improves his artistic language. Raffaele Attanasio is a pianist, arranger and producer. During his career he collaborated with artists such as Orlando Voorn for the personal compilation on Nightvision Records.

Raffaele made remixes for Trapez, Gynoid and the last is called Telrae for Reimut Van Bonn. At the moment his success Black Bloc Ep (NON 001, 2011) is on charts. It's the first output on the spanish label. It's about a work made up of solid and snare techno groove. It's also going to come out the remixes version (NON002, 2012). The artist has choosen Italy as his home. Raffaele wishes one day the public will be less xenofile because it should be proud of italians talents and don't make them live the "Bel Paese". European artists should be less envious of italians.<br />Raffaele Attanasio is the proof of italians success. ]]></description>

  <source url="http%3A%2F%2Fwww.mixcloud.com%2Feisengrau%2Fgiorgio-gigli-live-dommune-tokyo-24-5-2012%2F"><![CDATA[Giorgio Gigli LIVE @ Dommune - Tokyo 24-5-2012]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://d1lolb6yyp8wyu.cloudfront.net/w/300/h/300/q/85/upload/images/extaudio/daf78def-faea-41ac-8111-821f15efd8bc.jpeg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />After a deep exploration of several kinds of electronic dance music, in a broad evolutionary path, Giorgio Gigli's music has assumed an intense and personal form of communication.<br />The modules emerging from his compositions run across a process where moods are transformed into waves, layers and substrates that are ready to catch and overwhelm the listener without changing original content.<br />His skill is to transmit an accurate signal using undiscovered frequencies inspired by desolate and noir tinged landscapes. Giorgio transforms his material. Voids, pitfalls, drones and dilated melodies become intricate, sophisticated, and hypnotic rhythmic equipment that runs the risk of constantly changing classicist techno aesthetics in a conceptual derivation close to his soul. Giorgio loves ambient music that dues to its descriptive power allows him to analyze and render every vibration and vision, both during production and his long dj sets, where he explores empty rooms that are filled with vintage recordings, ethereal drones and field sonority. This particular working method is also reflected in his harder sets, where rhythm increases tension while it is moving forward unchallenged through industrial echoes, robotic tricks and building grooves that produce shaped variations of his meaning. Substance thickens to provide a thoughtful and reflexive listening experience. All these elements are poured into his project "Zooloft Records", a platform in constant update and in constant assimilation between old-school ethics (strongly linked to vinyl usage) and futuristic sounds which owe much to the futurist aesthetics of sixties sci-fi movies.<br />Zooloft is the materialization of a precise idea through a precise message: We Still Try ! ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<a target="_blank" href="http://www.sendspace.com/file/l2rezl">http://www.sendspace.com/file/l2rezl</a><br /><br /><a href="http://imageshack.us/photo/my-images/694/rataap.png/" target="_blank"><img src="http://img694.imageshack.us/img694/6735/rataap.th.png" border="0"/></a><br /><br />Ernesto,  has been in the electronic music scene for almost a decade now. At the beginning of his career, after being a guitar enthusiast for many years during his teenage highscholl-college years , started to get interested in electronic music, this was thanks to bands and producers  such as The Prodigy, Depeche Mode, Fatboy Slim, Cassius, and many others, and in later years producers that actually made him evolve and understand techno such as Mars Volta, James Holden, Gabriel Ananda, Dominik Eulberg, John Dahlback, and many others.  This was a new way of life for Ernesto, sounds and beats, were basically a new wave of music in America and mostly Latin America  .  So he started to teach himself how to mix on beats,  how to use turntables and cd players.  At a very quick pace Ernesto started getting noticed by his Techno Minimal sessions in different  local clubs of El Salvador, over the next 2 years, started recording his sets as demos and started getting noticed out to  the local and international promoters market,  got the attention of many promoters that wanted some new fresh beats, so Ernesto  started to get more involved in the electronic scene in the  Central American and South American countries, getting his sets and gigs posted on many electronic music websites, such as Detroit Institute of Techno, blogs, online radios, and interviews regarding his achievements, with local and regional Radios shows, live and broadcasts(Guatemala, Panama, Honduras)  started getting much more recognition for his accomplishments as a electronic music dj/producer.<br />Ernesto has been involved with many electronic music sessions all over his region, such as Guatemala city, that sponsored the biggest international electronic music festival in Central America , Rave Del Castillo in 2008, with over 50 international DJs form all over the world, and still the biggest in the region. Since 2007 until today Guatemala and El Salvador have been the local scenarios for Ernesto, being invited many times to local clubs and raves. Also having presentations in Tegucigalpa, Honduras with local and international DJs. Using Traktor Scratch Pro 2 and/or Ableton live<br /> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Dubtronica consists of electronic beats played in a downbeat manner. It is much lower in speed than techno and generally warmer than dance-oriented electronica. The genre is repetitive but rewards careful listener attention. Some tracks use reggae toasters or singers to produce a more accessible form of the music.<br /><br /> ]]></description>
