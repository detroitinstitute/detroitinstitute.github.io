	<description><![CDATA[Ten years ago this month, back in a time before MP3, <br />IM, Myspace, Facebook, Twitter, and the like,<br />Cognition Audioworks' Andrew Duke spoke to author<br />Dan Sicko about Techno Rebels: The Renegades Of Electronic Funk,<br />his book that would go on to be published in June 1999.<br /><br />To celebrate the forthcoming tenth anniversary of this <br />important book, Duke's interview with Dan Sicko, along with some <br />songs personally selected by Dan Sicko, has just been<br />added to the Andrew Duke's In The Mix show archive; <br />you can listen to this feature, included with full tracklisting, here:<br /><br />http://cognitionaudioworks.com/AndrewDukeInTheMix.html<br /><br />Also, by request, a couple of shows from earlier in 2009 have been<br />re-uploaded; to make way for these re-additions, some mp3 files<br />have had to be moved.<br /><br />Please check the show archive page <br />for updated show links and full tracklistings for all shows, plus <br />guest DJ mixes from Daniel Bell, Alland Byallo, Colette, Minto George, Jason Pelletier, <br />a live PA from Stewart Walker, and the <br />interviews with Aux 88 and Dan Sicko:<br /><br />http://cognitionaudioworks.com/AndrewDukeInTheMix.html<br /><br />Thanks.<br />Take care.<br />Andrew ]]></description>
