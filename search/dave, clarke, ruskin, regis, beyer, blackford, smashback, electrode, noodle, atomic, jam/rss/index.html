UK Bass originator Paul Blackford is joined by some of the scenes future stars including fellow Bass Gun operator, Smashback and the Data Trace Records collective. <br /><br />Since it's inception over four years ago, Manchester's Electrode event has gone on to acclaim an international reputation as as the kind of event that offers fresh, cutting edge, dancefloor based electronic music with an atmosphere that most nights could only wish for. <br /><br />Their music policy draws on many elements including electro, techno, breakbeat, dubstep and acid. Past guests have included:- Si Begg, Tim Wright, Bill Youngman, Ardisson, Ade Fenton, Lief Ryan, Cynthia Stern, Cutlass Supreme, Sir Real, Dark Mode, Warlock, NoYeahNo and Stormfield to name but a few. <br /><br />The Noodle story is similar, coming into existence just over 2 years ago and quickly acquiring a reputation for quality underground beats. The only place in Nottingham that you can hear Detroit Electro-bass alongside Swedish wonkyness! Guests have included DMX Krew, Cynthia Stern, MLZ, Lief Ryan, Luke's Anger, Peter Mangalore, Spewis and Computer Controlled. <br /><br />With the more recent success of labels Data-Trace and Bass Gun, spawned off the back of Electrode and now holding their own amongst the most repected and <br />established labels around, the collective's reputation and respect continually grows. <br /><br />********************<br />coach travel from Nottingham.
