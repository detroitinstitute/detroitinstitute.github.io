	<description><![CDATA[John Acquaviva is probably best known for founding the seminal second wave Detroit techno label Plus 8, but did you know that he's also one of the founders of Beatport?  Although he still lives in London, Ontario (Canada) a little ways east of Windsor/Detroit East he's come a long way since Plus 8 first took off.  Besides running the "category killer" of online electronic music stores he also pioneered the use of Final Scratch, the product that allows you to treat MP3s as if you owned them on vinyl -- and the man controls perhaps the largest collection of electronic music MP3s in the world.  We might consider a bit like cheating to amass your music collection by controlling the means to its distribution but consider this: the man also owns 50,000 pieces of vinyl.<br /><br />Otherwise, he's been DJing around the world pioneering electro-as an electro-house and he's just podcasted his latest mix.  You can check him out next month in Detroit at DEMF.<br /><br /><a href="http://john-acquaviva.com/podcast/mp3/electronic_04-07.mp3">Download mp3</a><br /><br />Total time 1:05:30 ]]></description>
