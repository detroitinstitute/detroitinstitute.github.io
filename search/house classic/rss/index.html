From the Rejected crew including Joris Voorn of Rotterdam who is gonna yet release that remix of Kevin Saunderson's Bassline on KMS.  That classic Detroit techno tune from 1991 was originally pressed on vinyl to play from the inside of the record to the outer edge of the record!  You may also recognize Joris from his piano-breakdown absolute dancefloor-destroying anthem 'Incident' on Sino in 2004.

	<description><![CDATA[00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />Ed, you're a nerd.<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Edit's Website</a><br /><br />01 - Cristian Vogel "Ninja" Tresor 35 [Sirius LP 1995]<br /><br />This track of Cris' has always been a pain in my backside. I love it, but can never find much to play with it. To this day I've never found 1 other record or track that I can say I really think meshes well with it. It makes me curse and sweat. Although the sweat may just be the heat right now.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/44356">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />02 - Chris Sattinger "Joy Etc." Subvoice 10 [The mumbler Ep 1997]<br />Chris Sattinger, AKA Mono Ekagra, Timeblind, Keek and a few others has always been a hell of a producer. All the stuff he put out on the Mid-west acid labels and Probe was awesome. Even his dubstep stuff these days is pretty rocking. This is the record that contains the track "Fun in the Murky". Do I have to tell you what that means or can ya'll figure it out?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/113245">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />03 - Aeox "She's Gotta Gun" Mental Ind. 02 [Paranoid EP 2001]<br /><br />This is by far the biggest most bad ass Techno track you'll ever hear. Aeox at their prime. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/98513">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />04 - Blackmass Plastics "Beatings" Rag &amp; Bone 11 [Four Aces Ep 2006]<br />Kick step you way on over and enjoy blackmass with me. As mentioned the last few shows in a row: I'm newly hooked on BMP. can anyone recommend some of his older releases to me? Something I should check out for sure.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/602564">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />05 - Queaver &amp; Versis "Dr. Pest" Error 04 [De Nischel Ep 2006]<br /><br />Q&amp;V are usually hiding on a b-side somewhere with only one track to their name on a comp. This time however, they've got, well, the b-side again, but at least this time they got the whole damn side! I'm a huge fan of their newest track on Kugelbox 5. "..and I hate to cook!" The half time breakdown made <a href="http://www.fukhouse.ca">fukhouse</a> get silly.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/839068">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />06 - Dj Funk "Funk U Up (Dj Rush Berlin Mix)!" Pro-Jex 54 [Funk U Up! Ep 2004]<br />I bought this EP for the Begg mix, but ended up liking the Rush Berlin mix better once it was in my posession. Go figure, I'm not really a Rush fan at all, but there are some gems and gold bits strewn throughout his prolific career.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/223085">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />07 -  Aeox "2:0" Neue Heimat 32 [Easy Jetset EP 2007]<br />This is possibly the last Aeox Ep we'll ever see unfortunately. Both Hanno and Alex have parted to work on other things. In theory what this means is more releases from the two of them. Not as Aeox, but hey I'll take what I can get.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/935843">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />08 - Nino Fight "Ca Flotte (Jason Leach Slight Remix)" Mercurochrome 06 [Patate Fight EP ]<br />I don't know if anyone else considers this a classic joint, but I sure do. it's got "I still remember it and it's 10 years later" written all over it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/301388">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />09 - RV "Kill Me" Bombtrap 04 [Bombsplit 1 EP 2006]<br />I was playing the flip side to this for awhile, but only just realized that I hadn't really given RV's two track on this side much of a chance. Zing...it's good too. I really need to buy less vinyl so that I can fully appreciate what I do have in a timely manner.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/797341">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />10 - Sueme &amp; Total Useful "RDA" Input-Output 14 [Motorboy EP 2006]<br />I love this Ep and am glad that I sent Sueme to Cynthia at I-O (Mr. braggery runs amok!) when he was looking for a home for it. Sueme as some of you know used to be half of Subhead and Total useful is a Japanese lad if my memory serves me correct. Phil went on about him, but now I've forgotten it all. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/989550">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />11 - Subhead "Unknown" Subhead 14 [14 EP 1998]<br />At my local record store -- when I had one -- I was known as the guy who bought the weird stuff. Suited me just fine, but one day the owner got this record in. I don't think I had too much Subhead at this point. Maybe one other Ep and I'd seen them live in Toronto once around this time too. Point to that was..I bet you it was this EP that sent me round the bend and had me looking past the Detroit and more for the Real Techno.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/61962">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />12 - Paul Birken "Fender Bender" Tonewrecker 12 [Junk Profanity EP 2006]<br />Fender Bender is dirty. So very dirty. Paul should be outlawed. The very least...tar and feather him! Seriously bad ass...acidgrungecoretootyfruitybassno<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/883378">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />13 - Sutekh "Shiura" Belief Systems 04 [Deadpan Escarpment LP 1998]<br />Near the end of the 90's was when I was on my "minimal" kick. That was when I started buying up the Sutekh, Twerk and Kit Clayton stuff. I thought it was awesome (still do!), but then a few years went by and I noticed that there was more and more coming out. And less and less of it was worth buying. Fast forward to 2007. The situation hasn't improved. I can't stand 99.9% of whatcomes out in the "minimal" bins these days. Why can't Sutekh come back to his former glory? Seth...give us one last romp in the woods.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/8777">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />14 - Elec Pt. 1 "Unknown" Bunker 3067 [Dangerous For The Environment EP 2007]<br />Unh Unh. Acid, Cologne style yo. I don't know about Dangerous for the Environment, but it's mucking up the needles real good.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/967424">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />15 - Debo "World War 3" Dance Mania 214 [A Lil Somethiin-Somethin EP ]<br />I don't know who Debo is, but I can say that it was a Toronto Dj who first played this and hooked me on it. Vortex was in the house!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/138913">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />16 - Traxmen "Let Me See You Butterfly" Dance Mania 68 [Basement Traxx Vol 2 EP 1994]<br />Traxmen rocked. This Ep however, has a secret weapon on it. "Indoor use Only" will force that grin on your face to record proportions.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/1585">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />17 - Luke's Anger "Method To Madness" Tiger Bass 02 [Give Em Some Freq Ep 2007]<br />I shouldn't even say anything about this EP or Luke. I've been going on about him so much it's getting stupid now. Oh well. Luke rocks. Deal with it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/945493">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e67%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-12-2007.mp3">Download the July 12th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />When I say Bleep, you say yeaaaahhhhh!<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Edit's Web Site</a><br /><br />01 - Z-Bomb "Unknown" Bunker [Keepers Of The Cheese Ep 2007]<br />Along the lines of old Circuit Breaker and other such tastey stuff. This track is a stab at the heart of those who like their music clean and in it's place. No idea who this Z-Bomb cat is, but we all know what Bunker is. Or we should at any rate. They're currently in one of their runs of good music. Always have to take advantage of that when it happens.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/974792">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />02 - Fugo "System Overload" Neue Heimat 24 [Robots Engaged In Bondage EP]<br />Another great track off an EP I've been toting around a lot again. It's a slow burner, it catches your ear without you really catching it doing so. Neue heimat needs to step up the pace with it's releases. I choose to ignore the rumour of no more Neue Heimats until I hear it right from someone's mouth who at the very least holds the position of CEO or higher.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/265770">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />03 - Digital Princezz "Lazy Milk Man" Mutter 13 [The Owner Of Half The World EP 2001]<br />There is some controversy over who exactly DP is. I personally don't care. I do know that about half of what DP releases is some pretty pimpin Techno. I can live with that. I wasn't too huge a fan of the latest DP on Feinwerk. It's ok, but what that means is the next one will probably rock.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/47420">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />04 - Neil Landstrumm "Pussy Puppy" Tresor 170 [Glamourama EP 2001]<br />I think this EP had something to do with a video game..??? I'm probably wrong. I can't even remember where that silly nonsense crept into my head from. I can tell you with certainty that this whole record is a bad-ass record. As you can tell for yourself if you're here already in the set.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/7074">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />05 - TJR "I'm In The Pocket" Tonewrecker 13 [I'm In The Pocket EP 2007]<br />When I initially heard the track sample for this when the release was announced I wasn't keen on the TJR mix. I absolutely loved Paul Birken's, but this mix didn't sit well with me. Now that I have the record and I can hear it loud and clear and at full length...I can tell you it's awesome. One of those cross-genre songs I love so much. I'll be able to listen and or play this anywhere and it'll go over well with whomever.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/985947">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />06 - Luke's Anger "Yo Ass" Bowwow 05 [Dead Like Elvis Ep 2006]<br />This EP has future classic written all over it. Of course that's just me being cheeky with my markers, but it's for good reason. I can't even really describe the overall sound of the EP. it's got so much variety crammed into 4 tracks it should be made into the National Anthem for one of the smallish countries.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/679554">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />07  - Blackmass Plastics "Gatesmasher" Bowwow 06 [Quarantine Zone EP 2007]<br />Blackmass is a new found artist for me. Someone forgot to keep me in the loop a few years back for about 10 minutes and it resulted in me missing out on some gold. Big up the Uk badness this guy represents. I love it and want more.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/965772">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />08 - Fix "Dope Computer" KMS 43 [Flash EP 1992]<br />I think we all know this record. By ear at any rate. Now you know what it is, if you didn't already. Classic tune on the flip, but Dope Computer is just as good and doesn't get as much air time. Changed that!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/4649">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />09 - Smooky "Fresh (Feat. Nino-Fight, MC Coeld'r, Dj Idem)" Electronik Weed Crew 07 [Do You Remembmer Ep 2007]<br />A lot of nerds went on saying this EP wasn't as good as previous Smooky/EWC material. Sure it may be a change of pace for them, but if you want to get all nasty every time someone tries something a tad different than I suggest eating something long and cumbersome. Ho! It's great fun, who doesn't like Swedish Mc'ing on top of a Kool and the Gang's remix of "Fresh"? <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/981524">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />10 - Jacob London "The Casino Squirrels and Lounge Shooter" Utensil 19 [Droppin Squirrels EP 2007]<br />I actually played the wrong song on this EP, but I figured it was too late to turn back. It's still good of course. Anyone who's live-sets involve singing into a vocoder stuffed into a monkey's anus can't go too wrong.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/952351">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />11 - The Wee Djs "Kick it VIP" Combat Recordings 10 [Darkhorse Dubs Ep 2006]<br />Another Wee track. I'm a big Wee fan. The low end, whether it's distorted or not, is always done proper. The little extra squiggly bleeps are what do my head in though. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/837034">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />12 - Daze Maxim "Unknown" White<br />The one sheet that came with this has fallen out. I believe it's Serial killer's Haircut 31, but since the info has been lost I can't be sure. I should have markered it on like the rest I know. Ok. I'm 98% sure this is SKH 01. Confirmation so I can write it on the damn record already?<br /><br />13 - Blackmass Plastics "Freak House" Rag & Bone 11 [Four Aces Ep 2006]<br />Yadda Yadda BMP. Right after I heard the Bowwow Ep I did some digging for any other BMP I might like. The problem was I couldn't find one I didn't like and this was the only other one in stock. My eyes are peeled now.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/602564">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />14 - Jason Leach "Untitled" Input-Output 11 [Beateater EP 2005]<br />Cynthia Stern's label is currently one of my favorites. Top 5 for sure. It's likely to stay there for a while too. I could see him messing it all up by suddenly only releasing Germanic Polka mash-ups or something. Great label + Jason Leach = Holy trouser trout! The long chiptune/breabeat gem on the flip is what I usually play the snot out of, I thought I'd try this side out today. Sounds like I should have checked it out sooner.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/601281">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />15 - Youngman & Landstrumm "Double Bag It" Input-Output 09 [Destroyaz EP 2005]<br />The Destroyaz they call themselves when touring together and that's exactly what they do. A certified legend and another one in the making?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/384532">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />16 - Joy Division "She's Lost Control (Neil Landstrumm Cover Version)" Scandinavia 25 [Factory Revival Ep 2006]<br />When Neil takes hold of the reins and vocals are involved he seems to get better and better. I can't remember an instance of it not being awesome, but it improves every time as well. This one was a project that sat close to home for him, influential music from his early music beginnings.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/678334">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />17 - Caucasian Boy "Honey Dip (Prime Cutz Mix)" Strictly Rhythm 12201 [HoneyDip/Northern Lights EP 1993]<br />There's always room for acid. This is a bit of an oldie that may not sit well with some. I would even be tempted to say it's a bit of a light weight these days. I was in the mood for it though so what I can say?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/31561">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />18 - Lambda "Hold On Tight (Laidback Luke Remix)" La Maison Grande [Hold On Tight LP 1999]<br />I first heard the original mix of this played by Barry Weaver back in the 90's sometime. I didn't know what it was at the time, but it stuck in my head. I was thoroughly stoked when I was skimming through new releases one day and discovered not only what it was, but that it was also being repressed. I love those happy occurences!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/134603">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />19 - DadaBleep "Nikeshirts" RZ Music 20 [Nikeshirts EP 2007]<br />RZ rocks out again with another record that could have been written 15 years ago, but wasn't.A new take on the classic acid sound. Always welcome in my home. It reminds me of another record that was big about 2 years ago. And now for the life of me I can't remember just what the hell that other record is. I'll ponder some more...<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/988496">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e66%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-05-2007.mp3">Download the July 5th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Track-list:<br />00 - 3d!t "Bleep Intro"<br />I still giggle at this damn thing.<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">More info...</a><br /><br />01 - The Don "The Horn Song" Strictly Rhythm [The Horn Song EP 1998]<br />Choon! A relatively recent acquaintance of mine loves this song. I found out last week. So this first tune is for Danielle of <a href="http://myspace.com/blubuni">Blubuni</a>.  Virtually all of Pierre's stuff is good music, but this is definitely one of his personal best.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/72517">More info...</a><br /><br />02 - Blake Baxter "Energizer" Tresor 97 [Tresor 3 LP 2000]<br />Another old Detroit gem. I've been on a bit of a motor city rampage lately. Digging up a lot of old stuff and buying a few new ones. Detroit is sorta where I started off so I guess it's only likely I detour through my old haunt from time to time.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/9010">More info...</a><br /><br />03 - Mark Seven "Gonz Gets F.U." Rotation 98011 [Dancefloor Techniques Volume 1 EP 1998]<br />I don't quite recall how I discovered Mark Seven, but I'm glad I did. Out of his half dozen or so EPs there is only 1 I only have 1 copy of. The man knows Techno and Funk like I know my navel and junk. This EP in particular is known to anyone who has heard Dave Angel's "39 Flavours of Tech Funk" mix CD. I think 3 of the 4 tracks are featured on it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/4984">More info...</a><br /><br />04 - TSR "The 7th Otto Odie 7th Otto" HorSpielMusik 44 [Transexual Swiss Rebels EP 2004]<br />TSR are definitely one of my favorite acts right now. Those three nerds do no wrong. Mostly because their wrong is so right. I'm lucky enough to get all kinds of random tracks and remixes from them and let me tell you, the stuff they actually release is great, but they're sitting on gold as well. Brats! The Ep Sleeve says that this record was only Robi and Fredi...I guess Tomi sat this one out. Still smells like Teen Spirit to me though.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/346823">More info...</a><br /><br />05 - Subhead "Unknown" Subhead 02 [Forest Friends EP 1996]<br />One of the best Subhead records to date. I dare you to challenge me on that one. This isn't even the track the EP is known for. I thought I'd give that one a rest. I find the first couple Subhead records (on their label) are crazy good and then it kinda tapers off in the middle of the catalog only to pick up again around 13 or 14...I guess it's good that "tapers off" for Subhead means it's still better than 90% of the Techno out there. They've got that going for them...<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/54857">More info...</a><br /><br />06 - Lief Ryan "Royale Battle" Iron Oxide 04 [Las Vegas Of The North EP 2005]<br />I completely forgot about this record. I've had it for 2 years apparently and this month is the first time I've put it in my bag to play out. The only reason I rediscovered it is because of my girlfriend. She put on a CD with this track mixed in it. I probably made the CD the week I got the record...It took me a while to figure out what it was again, but I'm glad I did. Lief rocked it hard for Iron Oxide!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/579297">More info...</a><br /><br />07 - Outsider "Sex is Extra (No Assembly Firm's .Dotbleep Re-Edit)" Junior Boy's Own 12 [Sex is Extra EP 2006]<br />This is one of those tasty Chicago House records that's come out recently that I can't seem to put down. It grabs people's attention and works well with most anything else I've ever thrown into it. According to Sylvia, my girlfriend it has the three things that go into a perfect track: Bass, Tweak and Vox. I can't refute that.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/795689">More info...</a><br /><br />08 - Wyndell Long "Chapped Lips" Peacefrog 50 [She Heard Me Cry EP 1996]<br />Wyndell Long is awesome. Techno, House, Booty...whatever he does. Solid production. Solid understanding of a track. Knows how to jack. This is an older one I first heard played by Terry Mullan. There's another old Wyndell on Peacefrog as well, but it's a more Deep house oriented number. I still recommend it though.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/4511">More info...</a><br /><br />09 - Frankie Bones "Unknown" Last Label 01 [(Pro)File. (Pro)Duce EP 2004]<br />I got this from Frankie back before it came out. I had just made a record order through him and he ended up throwing in 3-4 extras into the box. This was one of them. It's a great rework of DHS' "House of God". <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/349083">More info...</a><br /><br />10 - Neil Landstrumm "Help Me" Music Man 98 [Asphyxia EP 2002]<br />Neil on point. The Bassline does my head in. The flipside with The Horrorist is catchy as hell as well in a sort of haunting chant kinda way. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/117800">More info...</a><br /><br />11 - Infiniti "Skyway" Tresor 105 [Skynet: The Infiniti Colection LP 1998]<br />I started the mix off with a track I know Danielle of Blubuni likes and now I toss a track in that I know Eric of Blubuni likes. It's a great track. proof they know their music. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/14106">More info...</a><br /><br />12 - Kenny Larkin "Catatonic (Carl Craig Mix)" R&amp;S Records 94058 [Catatonic Mixes EP 1994]<br /><br />I don't think this song can be truly apreciated in a mp3 mix. It needs to be felt as well as heard. The low end in this one does something to you on a good system. The morphing bass and clanks don't stop moving and they funnel your energy so very well...Gold star!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/7018">More info...</a><br /><br />13 - Luke Hess "Omniscient (Falko Brocksieper Remix)" Beretta Grey 03 [Absolute Truth EP 2007]<br />I don't know who this is. I was given this record at a gig. It's forgettable almost entirely. The Falko mix however sparks it up. It's his tracky nature shining through I think. That and his more 'full' sounding production. Takes it about 3 notches past the original.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/981702">More info...</a><br /><br />14 - Massi DL "Minimal Mushrooms" Frankie Records 18 [1UP EP 2007]<br /><br />I like the bloops in this one. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/953794">More info...</a><br /><br />15 - Jeremy P. Caulfield "Hollow Sky" Trapez 21 [The Cities EP 2002]<br />Jeremy is a local boy, although he's moved to Germany. This is one of his earlier releases and to be honest is only 1 of 2 that I've purchased. I think this one is his best. It hits square in the dance floor.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/84090">More info...</a><br /><br />16 - Massi DL "Minimal Mushrooms" Frankie Records 18 [1UP EP 2007]<br /><br />I like the bloops in this one. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/953794">More info...</a><br /><br />17 - Jeremy P. Caulfield "Ripped Backsides" Trapez 21 [The Cities EP 2002]<br />Jeremy is a local boy, although he's moved to Germany. This is one of his earlier releases and to be honest is only 1 of 2 that I've purchased. I think this one is his best. It hits square in the dance floor.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/84090">More info...</a><br /><br />18 - S-max "Limited (S-max Kool Aid Edit)" Overdrive 158 [Limited Remixes EP 2005]<br /><br />S-max is one of the few "minimal" or "tech-house" producers wo I buy without question. This release is a shining example why. It's got the goods in spades. The vocal which comes out almost as an exhalation plus the thin little acid line is enough to satisfy even the hardest of the core. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/512949">More info...</a><br /><br />19 - Unknown<br />I don't know what's up with this EP, even took me a while to find the discogs link since there is so little info on it. It's a great Acid record, but beyond that it's a mystery. It's one of my little scores that have been made. You search through enough of what stores call "Acid house" and eventually you actually find one or two.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/654173">More info...</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e64%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2006-21-2007.mp3">Download the June 21st, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Bleep 62 from Trevor Wilkes.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e62%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2006-07-2007.mp3">Download mp3</a><br /><br />Bleep Radio #62<br />Aired: June 7th, 2007<br />Mixed by: Trevor Wilkes<br /><br /><br />None of the guest mixes that have been lined up are in yet so I filled the gap with a random bunch of records. It seems I was in the mood for some older stuff this week. Plenty of Acid to go around!<br /><br />Track-list<br /><br />00 - 3d!t "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />A long, long time ago in a totally different era I asked Ed to make me up an intro for Bleep. This was the teaser that's been done so far. I may as well use it!<br /><br />01 - The Jungle Brothers "I'll House You %28Houseapella%29" Warlock Records 22 [I'll House You EP 1988]<br />This is one of my favorite house tracks, it's a combination of the vocals and the Todd Terry beats that make it excellent. Todd can make my rump jump!<br /><br />02 - Soul Grabber & The Stickmen "Hey Bryce" NRK 22 [Untitled EP 1999]<br />I don't actually know where this record came from. It doesn't ring any bells or even memory fragments. I needed something kinda tribal / filtered disco to jump from the Jungle Brothers to Surfin' Bernard though. It'll probably never be played again. I think we all discover little crustys in the shelves or bins from time to time eh?<br /><br />03 - Surfing Bernard "Partyboy" Shed Records 01 [Untitled EP 2003]<br />!!! I love Surfin Bernard. They take the rawkus go get em attitude of the sort of Techno I like and meld it with lyrics that remind me of old Funk or even older Rock. I need more of them for sure.<br />Discog's link w/ more information<br /><br />04 - Dave Angel "Funk Music" Island Records [Funk Music EP 1997]<br />Dave has these periods, most of them in the mid to late 90's I think where he just blew the socks off of everyone track-wise. It was distinctive and full of thump funk. This isa great/fun track and it's probably one of the worse ones from that era. So much more was even better. I love one in particular...if only I can remember what the hell it's called!<br /><br />05 - Inner City "Good Life" White<br />Classic. I'll go ages not touching it as I've only got some crappy white label of it - so it kinda hides for long periods. But every so often I'll put it on to see what it is and the starting hooks me all over again. It starts off so Art of Noise I can't resist..<br /><br />06 - Dj Fex "Acid Forever (Dj Tommy Four Seven Remix)" Brique Rouge 63 [Acid Forever EP 2007]<br />The original Fex mix doesn't really do much for me, but the Tommy... mix is good stuff. It's got a newer, cleaner, acid sound, but still has all the elements that old stuff was sportin. Don't ask me to break it down anymore. I refuse to put too much thought into it.<br /><br />07 - Brother From Another Planet "Acid Wash Conflict" 7th City 22 [Seventh City Classics Volume 1 EP 2007]<br />I always wondered why this record went for so much on Ebay, I mean it's a decent old acid track, but the money some people spent on it was just plain silly. I only paid $13 CAD. Why? Because I just waited until it was repressed of course. Well....it was the song on the flip I wanted more so. In the next Bleep you'll hear that!<br /><br />08 - Jacob London "Rise Squirrels Rise" Utensil Recordings 19 [Dropping Squirrels EP 2007]<br />Retarded, stop-start, Disco! I'm not too keen on many Jacob London releases, but this new one had 2-3 tracks on it that put some shimmy in my step.<br /><br />09 - Armando "Downfall" Cbag [Untitled EP 2007]<br />Classic! Again, this is an old acid track I'd wanted for years and just never stumbled across for a decent price. I was thoroughly stoked when it was repressed. If this song doesn't make you want to jack, your jack muscle must be sprained. For those of you who like the acid line, but prefer harder Techno....this acid line was featured in one of the recentish Killa Production EP's. If you can't find it and want it just ask and I'll point you in the right direction.<br /><br />10 - ### "01" Feinwerk 13 [Untitled EP 2007]<br />I still don't know who the hell this is. It's the one track on this EP I like though.<br /><br />11 - Paul Birken "Numbskull" L'Hallucidite 07 [Hors Serires 07 EP 2007]<br />This is another example of a track that I wanted for years, but went for far too much on Ebay. Originally on the Surfin' Superior LP on Woody McBride's Communique label (Mid-West Acid!). This track is now resting on it's laurel's on this French label. I made the mistake of burning this mix for my car. Now I get constant looks of wonderment when the passing drivers see me fist pumping to this track.<br /><br />12 - Public Energy "Three 'O Three" Probe 05 [Three 'O Three EP 1992]<br />I seem to have been on a bit of a rave track, acid kick. Public Energy is also known as Speedy J. I'm not a fan of the stuff he does now a days, but there was a time when he owned me. This is a Canadian label too. Take that world! Unfortunately Probe ended it's run a long time ago. Fortunately it ended with one of the best LP's ever released...<br /><br />13 - Dj Lenk "Untitled" Drumcode 26 [142 EP 2003]<br />I think Lenk is Jesper Dahlback. I'm not sure and when ever I do check it out I always forget in fairly short order. This is probably the only Drumcode I've bought out of the last 25 or so...(what are they even up to now???). It's a cranky, frenetic acid stomper that tugs at my heart strongs.<br /><br />14 - Circuit Breaker "Creator" Probe 30 [The End LP 1996]<br />Yes, the best acid record ever released. Hands down. Two slabs of wax with perfection etched into each side. Circuit Breaker??? it's Richie Hawtin when he had balls. A long, long time ago, before the neutering.<br /><br />15 - X-ES "Roller-Coaster" Freaky Records 1011 [Volume 1 EP 1991]<br />This is one of the many Eric Van Der Broek alias'. He has so many it's hard to remember, but this one was only used for two Ep's. Both old, both only had 1 good track that really didn't date poorly.<br /><br />16 - Unknown "Unknown" White<br />I probably knew what this record was at one point in my life, but not any more. I know that there are at least two loops from it that make it into a good portion of Neil Landstrumm's live-set. So if anyone recognizes this track...let me in on it so I can label the damn thing.<br /><br />17 - Juiceboxx & Dre Skull "Sweat %28Dre Skull's Dusted Bass Mix%29" Vicious Pop Records [Sweat Ep 2006]<br />For some reason I almost fell guilty for liking this song. Not sure why, maybe it's because I know my Girlfriend likes it as well. I'm still debating whether or not that's good...<br /><br /><br /><br />News:<br />The next Bleep which is a Daniel Bell and Todd Sines tribute/death match/versus type show may or may not air live next week. I'll be on Vacation. I've set Fun in the Murky to automatically publish the post with it though so it'll be there to grab, or you can just wait until I get home and put it out and about. ]]></description>
