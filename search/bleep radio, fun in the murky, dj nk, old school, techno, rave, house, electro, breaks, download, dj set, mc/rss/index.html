	<description><![CDATA[Tonight's Bleep (#92) is one that harks back quite a bit for me. Dj NK was playing out fairly often in Toronto when I first started going out regularly. So I heard him quite often and most memorably at his 'Liquid Adrenaline' parties.<br /><br />This set is one he passed over to me after I asked him if he had any of his old mixtapes still around. This specific tape was used to promote Liquid Adrenaline's party 'Time Warp 3' which was back in August of 1998. After nearly 10 years there are parts of the tape that didn't perhaps age as well as others, but on a whole I still really enjoy this mix. It's also been a few years since I heard Flipside...I'd forgotten all about him until he popped up during the first few tracks in this mix. <br /><br />01 808 State - CÃ¼bic<br />02 Eon - Spice<br />03 Joey Beltram - Joey Beltram<br />04 Altern 8 - Infiltrate 202<br />05 T99 - Anathasia<br />06 T99 - Nocturne<br />07 Quadrophonia - Quadrophonia<br />08 The Age Of Love - The Age Of Love (Jam & Spoon mix)<br />09 2 Unlimited - Get Ready For This<br />10 Felix - Don't You Want Me (Red Jerry mix)<br />11 Human Resource - Dominator (Joey Beltram mix)<br />12 Deadly Venom - Killer-Bass<br />13 Return of the Living Acid - Get Funky!<br />14 The Cotton Club - New Jack<br />15 Liquid - Sweet Harmony (DJ Icee mix)<br />16 Shup Up & Dance - Raving I'm Raving<br />17 2 Bad Mice - Bombscare ('94 remix)<br />18 4 Hero - Mr. Kirk's Nightmare<br />19 L.A.
