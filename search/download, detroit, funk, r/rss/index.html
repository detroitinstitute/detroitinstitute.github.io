	<description><![CDATA[Resident Advisor podcast issue 109 from The Mole isn't exactly techno but it's definitely got Detroit.  Enjoy something a little bit different.<br />"You gotta feel for Colin de la Plante. His Modern Deep Left Quartet pals went off and formed Cobblestone Jazz and now tour the world without him. His girlfriend broke up with him. And just this past week he broke his collarbone*, which explains why we didn't immediately have a tracklist ready for you. Can you blame him for making a mix entitled Soft Hits for Making Up and Breaking Up?"<br /><br />Tracklisting:<br />01. Terry Callier - Dancing Girl<br />02. Os Mutantes - Baby<br />03. Teddy Pendergrass - When Somebody Loves You Back<br />04. Gap Band - Outstanding<br />05. Ethel Beatty - I Know You Care<br />06. The Blackbyrds - Think Twice <br />07. J Dilla Jay Dee - Don't Cry<br />08. Sylvester - I've Been Down<br />09. Donny Hathway - Giving Up <br />10. The Temptations - I'm A Bachelor<br />11. Donny Hathway - I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know<br />12. Marvin Gaye - When Did You Stop Loving Me, When Did I Stop Loving You (Reprise)<br />12. Genty - Baby Goodnight<br />13. Noviciat De Soeurs Missionaires De Notre-Dame D'afrique & Four Religious Drummers - Yesu Ka Mkwebaze<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://ra1.residentadvisor.net/audio/RA109_080630_The-Mole-residentadvisor.net.mp3">Download mp3</a> ]]></description>
