The beat sets up<br />extreme pressure - deeply pumping! The introducing bass creates an nameless groove with<br />great harmonics.  A tiny squeaky synth behaves like a ball lightning and adds a particular<br />charm to the track. The producers are rolling out such an extraordinary carpet of sound that<br />the eight-minute arrangement is over too quick and you want to enjoy again and again. Great<br />track - full of emotion and warm atmosphere - far in the front and at home at any dance floor -<br />every time and everywhere!<br /><br />A2: Simplicity Always Wins"  You are going completely wrong if you would like to judge<br />the track from its name. You could think that the name is suitable in the beginning - hearing<br />the airy low-groove beat. Next step you get in touch with the constant bass and the forcing up<br />synths and effects and realize that the guys attached importance to extreme sonic quality.<br />A few elements merge and create a complex environment which you will listen in repeat mode until<br />you experienced every single bit. It's a ticket for a rich in content vacation at the Monoid universe!<br /><br />B1.: Meridian  B-Side surprise - extraordinary dance floor bomb.  Contrasts attract each<br />other - celebration par excellence! The beat pushes and agitates the feet on the dance floor.<br />The harmonic bass supported by the creamy and clear chords and ambience bursts the firm<br />atmosphere and you can hardly describe the created mood. This track provides a state of<br />emergency! Headbanger with strong emotions - must listen!<br /><br />B2.: Leaving is a special rounding up the broad range of moods on this EP. Tribal techno<br />meets tech-house - sounds easy  and housy but is pushing forward like techno.<br />Filtered guitar chords drip from the sweat-saturated ceiling. ]]></description>
