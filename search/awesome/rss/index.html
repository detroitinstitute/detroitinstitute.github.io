	<description><![CDATA[<img id="ncode_imageresizer_container_1" src="http://www.russian-techno.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/rtsw12_sm.jpg"><br /><br />1. RAIN - Electrobass Wave (4:45)<br />2. RAIN - Vocoder Love (5:45)<br />3. Neonicle - Psychonaut (3:48)<br />4. Neonicle - Test Tube (5:20)<br />5. Vadz - Mint (5:00)<br />6. Vadz - Ice World (5:00)<br />7. Thorn MD - Mirror Matter (5:10)<br />8. Thorn MD - Mecha Giallo (6:00)<br /><br />Different in sound and mood, these tracks were put together to sastisfy the most exacting robot's hunger. We start our therapy with St. Petersburg-based RAIN, a new artist on RT. Simple and elegant electro sound, bright melodies to warm you up in the beginning of the session. Next is Neonicle - 'northern' capital electro punk. A bit of psychedelia and a drop of noize for you here. His album is coming out on RT in February and is gonna be a f###ing awesome! Moving further - 2 tracks from Vadz. More dirt, static electricity, and images of distant worlds. Just add more volts if you feel sad! Thorn MD hails from Moscow. He's a doctor at the ICU in regular life and this is his first appearance at RT. 2 pieces of dark electro with sci-fi elements and dim voices end up our  therapy session today. Thanks everyone, hope our treatment made no harm to you!<br /><br /><b><a href="http://www.russian-techno.com/wp/archives/rtsw12.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">RELEASE PAGE</a></b><br /><b><a href="http://www.archive.org/download/Rtsw12VariousArtists-ElectroTherapy/Rtsw12VariousArtists-ElectroTherapy_vbr_mp3.zip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DOWNLOAD MP3</a></b><br /><b><a href="http://vadz.technoprom.su/rtsw12.rar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">DOWNLOAD WAV</a></b><br /><b><a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/russian-techno" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SUBSCRIBE</a></b> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[00:00] 00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />Edweird strikes again!<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Ed's site</a><br /><br />[01:00] 01 - TJR "I'm In The Pocket" Tonewrecker 13 [I'm In The Pocket EP 2007]<br /><br />I wont go on again about how I came to realize how much I like this track. For that you can refer to previous Bleeps. I will mention again that it'll probably be a long time before it leaves my bag so get used to hearing it. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/985947">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[05:33] 02 - Luke's Anger "Organ Monkey" Tigerbass 02 [Give Em Some Freq EP 2007]<br />Again I'm always going on about Luke's stuff. I've spoiled him enough. I'll relate a quick story instead. last Saturday my girlfriend and I went to the drive-in. Sitiing in the car, in line, waiting to pay, I was listening to this mix. At the point this track came on the car beside us gave us strange looks. I didn't say it was a good story...<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/945493">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[08:35] 03 - Sugar Experiment Station "Influence Technology" Scandinavia 03 [Ultimathule EP 1996]<br /><br />All four tracks on this EP should be drilled into people's head the very second they are born. Unless it's discovered that loud music is bad for newborns. I suspect it may be. it's classic in my circles and I suspect other's as well. Neil Landstrumm and Tobias Schmidt work together well now and seemingly always have. Although to be fair I didn't have to think that up myself. neil says so in his <a href="http://www.scandinavianyc.com/nickedidea.html">Archives</a><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/17554">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[11:50] 04 -  Tobias Schmidt "Systemshocker" Feinwerk 11 [Heavy Makeup EP 2007]<br />Another track, from another record, that wont be soon leaving the bag. Toby has been absolutely killing it the last few releases. he's always been someone I kept an eye out for, but it's reached a new level. It all started with the Monkey Tennis EP. Something changed. For the better.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/861897">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[15:48] 05 - Axel Sohns "Analog Komplex" Tonewrecker 11 [Circling The Wagons Ep 2006]<br /><br />I don't know if Axel has anything else lined up for release. I do know his label Kitty-Corner is putting out some killer releases though. I definitely urge everyone to check out the latest ep by TSR.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/883378">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[19:08] 06 - Lief Ryan "Da Shit!" Growth 02 [Unhealthy Living EP 2003]<br />I seem to have a strange relationship with Lief's stuff. I get it, love it, forget about it. Don't know why. Lately I've been digging back out and giving it the room to breathe and the playtime it deserves.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/213851">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[22:11] 07 - Rosie Brown "Bliss (D's Boom Bap Bleep Edition)" .dotbleep 11 [Bliss - Derrick Carter Remixes EP 2006]<br /><br />I firmly believe this track is being abused by myself. And yet I can't put it away. DC's magic touch has overwhelmed my senses with his cunning use of bleep and vocal!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/764184">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[26:40] 08 - Jamie Lidell "Freely Freekin" Mosquito 08 [Freekin The Frame EP 1997]<br />I've come to the conclusion that this is probably my favorite track. Most people start off sucking at least a little. jamie started off where most end up and has only gotten better since this record. Big up the TSR boys for hooking me up with this so I can have a 2nd copy. Not to hog it, but to be able to play the snot out of it without worrying about ruining my only copy!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/21253">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[29:58] 09 - Byron Stingily "Get Up! (Mousse T.'s Extended Mix)" Peppermint Jam [Get Up! Remixes EP 1996]<br /><br />This record is one of the few I catch myself singing along to. Brings me back to early party days and more specifically old Terry Mullan sets.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/50838">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[33:31] 10 - TSR "Robi Und Fredi" Don't 09 [Onion Tied To My Belt EP 2006]<br />I'm going to go out on a limb and say that only two of the TSR'ers were involved in this track. They finally got rid of that Tommy character!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/635266">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[36:07] 11 - Smash TV "Electronic Boy" Bpitch Control 20 [Rock On Boy Ep 2001]<br /><br />This was one of those songs that you hear out and go nuts trying to figure out what it was. I believe it was Mateo Murphy that finally id'd it for me that year. Via...the old Gtech mailing list. yes my memory is very selective, but quite often very good.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/39709">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[40:14] 12 - Luke's Anger "Strangle Hold" Don't 10 [Fistful Of Donkeys EP 2006]<br />Blah blah blah...see above. I do have this to say about the next Don't release though..."Readyyy now....." Sing it Frankie! ;) Tip!!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/722426">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[43:31] 13 - Subhead "Forest Friends" Subhead 02 [Forest Friends Ep 1996]<br /><br />Subhead of course being quite good at what they do did it again on the 2nd release of their own label. This is the track that most people buy it for if I do remember idle chat correctly. The release party for this EP was big news at the time and apparently was 5 shades of awesome. Subhead live and Claude Young when the music he played was still good? Yes please.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/54857">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[47:04] 14 - Tomas Nordstrom "Jagermiester" Don't 05 [Knights Of The Jager EP 2004]<br />This is a new addition to the bag, but it's been around the block. I made myself put it away for a while as I over played it big time when it first came out. I'm allowing myself to use it again. Sparingly. if I overdo it...suck it up.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/324535">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[50:22] 15 - Mark Hawkins "Frequency Respnose" Input-Output 15 [13 Years Of Raving EP 2007]<br /><br />Think of this as a teaser EP. It's not really. Not officially I don't think anyway. Mark's album worth of tracks that he WANTS A HOME FOR is all along the same vein as this ep. There's one difference....The LP is even better. It's got Bill Youngman and aLXe doing guest bits on it. Previews soon my pretties<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/912169">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[54:53] 16 - Cannibal Cooking Club "longpigchef (Bill Youngman Remix)" Cannibal Cooking Club 04 [Recooked Volume 1 EP 2005]<br />This is probably one of my favorite remixed tracks. Bill totally turned a decent CCC track into gold. A guy I work with who doesn't normally listen to anything electronic heard this on a cd I had. he was fist pumping within seconds. Uh..in the air.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/455990">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[57:32] 17 - Kylie Minogue "Slow (Tomas Nordstrom Feat. Chill Cover Version)" <br /><br />I had to include this track. I tossed it in at the very end as I believe it deserves a full play out. I wont bother telling you all just how much I love it. I'll let you decide for yourself just how damn catchy it is.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e69%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-26-2007.mp3">Download the July 26th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />Ed, you're a nerd.<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Edit's Website</a><br /><br />01 - Cristian Vogel "Ninja" Tresor 35 [Sirius LP 1995]<br /><br />This track of Cris' has always been a pain in my backside. I love it, but can never find much to play with it. To this day I've never found 1 other record or track that I can say I really think meshes well with it. It makes me curse and sweat. Although the sweat may just be the heat right now.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/44356">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />02 - Chris Sattinger "Joy Etc." Subvoice 10 [The mumbler Ep 1997]<br />Chris Sattinger, AKA Mono Ekagra, Timeblind, Keek and a few others has always been a hell of a producer. All the stuff he put out on the Mid-west acid labels and Probe was awesome. Even his dubstep stuff these days is pretty rocking. This is the record that contains the track "Fun in the Murky". Do I have to tell you what that means or can ya'll figure it out?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/113245">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />03 - Aeox "She's Gotta Gun" Mental Ind. 02 [Paranoid EP 2001]<br /><br />This is by far the biggest most bad ass Techno track you'll ever hear. Aeox at their prime. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/98513">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />04 - Blackmass Plastics "Beatings" Rag &amp; Bone 11 [Four Aces Ep 2006]<br />Kick step you way on over and enjoy blackmass with me. As mentioned the last few shows in a row: I'm newly hooked on BMP. can anyone recommend some of his older releases to me? Something I should check out for sure.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/602564">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />05 - Queaver &amp; Versis "Dr. Pest" Error 04 [De Nischel Ep 2006]<br /><br />Q&amp;V are usually hiding on a b-side somewhere with only one track to their name on a comp. This time however, they've got, well, the b-side again, but at least this time they got the whole damn side! I'm a huge fan of their newest track on Kugelbox 5. "..and I hate to cook!" The half time breakdown made <a href="http://www.fukhouse.ca">fukhouse</a> get silly.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/839068">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />06 - Dj Funk "Funk U Up (Dj Rush Berlin Mix)!" Pro-Jex 54 [Funk U Up! Ep 2004]<br />I bought this EP for the Begg mix, but ended up liking the Rush Berlin mix better once it was in my posession. Go figure, I'm not really a Rush fan at all, but there are some gems and gold bits strewn throughout his prolific career.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/223085">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />07 -  Aeox "2:0" Neue Heimat 32 [Easy Jetset EP 2007]<br />This is possibly the last Aeox Ep we'll ever see unfortunately. Both Hanno and Alex have parted to work on other things. In theory what this means is more releases from the two of them. Not as Aeox, but hey I'll take what I can get.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/935843">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />08 - Nino Fight "Ca Flotte (Jason Leach Slight Remix)" Mercurochrome 06 [Patate Fight EP ]<br />I don't know if anyone else considers this a classic joint, but I sure do. it's got "I still remember it and it's 10 years later" written all over it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/301388">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />09 - RV "Kill Me" Bombtrap 04 [Bombsplit 1 EP 2006]<br />I was playing the flip side to this for awhile, but only just realized that I hadn't really given RV's two track on this side much of a chance. Zing...it's good too. I really need to buy less vinyl so that I can fully appreciate what I do have in a timely manner.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/797341">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />10 - Sueme &amp; Total Useful "RDA" Input-Output 14 [Motorboy EP 2006]<br />I love this Ep and am glad that I sent Sueme to Cynthia at I-O (Mr. braggery runs amok!) when he was looking for a home for it. Sueme as some of you know used to be half of Subhead and Total useful is a Japanese lad if my memory serves me correct. Phil went on about him, but now I've forgotten it all. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/989550">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />11 - Subhead "Unknown" Subhead 14 [14 EP 1998]<br />At my local record store -- when I had one -- I was known as the guy who bought the weird stuff. Suited me just fine, but one day the owner got this record in. I don't think I had too much Subhead at this point. Maybe one other Ep and I'd seen them live in Toronto once around this time too. Point to that was..I bet you it was this EP that sent me round the bend and had me looking past the Detroit and more for the Real Techno.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/61962">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />12 - Paul Birken "Fender Bender" Tonewrecker 12 [Junk Profanity EP 2006]<br />Fender Bender is dirty. So very dirty. Paul should be outlawed. The very least...tar and feather him! Seriously bad ass...acidgrungecoretootyfruitybassno<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/883378">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />13 - Sutekh "Shiura" Belief Systems 04 [Deadpan Escarpment LP 1998]<br />Near the end of the 90's was when I was on my "minimal" kick. That was when I started buying up the Sutekh, Twerk and Kit Clayton stuff. I thought it was awesome (still do!), but then a few years went by and I noticed that there was more and more coming out. And less and less of it was worth buying. Fast forward to 2007. The situation hasn't improved. I can't stand 99.9% of whatcomes out in the "minimal" bins these days. Why can't Sutekh come back to his former glory? Seth...give us one last romp in the woods.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/8777">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />14 - Elec Pt. 1 "Unknown" Bunker 3067 [Dangerous For The Environment EP 2007]<br />Unh Unh. Acid, Cologne style yo. I don't know about Dangerous for the Environment, but it's mucking up the needles real good.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/967424">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />15 - Debo "World War 3" Dance Mania 214 [A Lil Somethiin-Somethin EP ]<br />I don't know who Debo is, but I can say that it was a Toronto Dj who first played this and hooked me on it. Vortex was in the house!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/138913">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />16 - Traxmen "Let Me See You Butterfly" Dance Mania 68 [Basement Traxx Vol 2 EP 1994]<br />Traxmen rocked. This Ep however, has a secret weapon on it. "Indoor use Only" will force that grin on your face to record proportions.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/1585">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />17 - Luke's Anger "Method To Madness" Tiger Bass 02 [Give Em Some Freq Ep 2007]<br />I shouldn't even say anything about this EP or Luke. I've been going on about him so much it's getting stupid now. Oh well. Luke rocks. Deal with it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/945493">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e67%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-12-2007.mp3">Download the July 12th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />When I say Bleep, you say yeaaaahhhhh!<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Edit's Web Site</a><br /><br />01 - Z-Bomb "Unknown" Bunker [Keepers Of The Cheese Ep 2007]<br />Along the lines of old Circuit Breaker and other such tastey stuff. This track is a stab at the heart of those who like their music clean and in it's place. No idea who this Z-Bomb cat is, but we all know what Bunker is. Or we should at any rate. They're currently in one of their runs of good music. Always have to take advantage of that when it happens.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/974792">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />02 - Fugo "System Overload" Neue Heimat 24 [Robots Engaged In Bondage EP]<br />Another great track off an EP I've been toting around a lot again. It's a slow burner, it catches your ear without you really catching it doing so. Neue heimat needs to step up the pace with it's releases. I choose to ignore the rumour of no more Neue Heimats until I hear it right from someone's mouth who at the very least holds the position of CEO or higher.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/265770">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />03 - Digital Princezz "Lazy Milk Man" Mutter 13 [The Owner Of Half The World EP 2001]<br />There is some controversy over who exactly DP is. I personally don't care. I do know that about half of what DP releases is some pretty pimpin Techno. I can live with that. I wasn't too huge a fan of the latest DP on Feinwerk. It's ok, but what that means is the next one will probably rock.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/47420">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />04 - Neil Landstrumm "Pussy Puppy" Tresor 170 [Glamourama EP 2001]<br />I think this EP had something to do with a video game..??? I'm probably wrong. I can't even remember where that silly nonsense crept into my head from. I can tell you with certainty that this whole record is a bad-ass record. As you can tell for yourself if you're here already in the set.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/7074">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />05 - TJR "I'm In The Pocket" Tonewrecker 13 [I'm In The Pocket EP 2007]<br />When I initially heard the track sample for this when the release was announced I wasn't keen on the TJR mix. I absolutely loved Paul Birken's, but this mix didn't sit well with me. Now that I have the record and I can hear it loud and clear and at full length...I can tell you it's awesome. One of those cross-genre songs I love so much. I'll be able to listen and or play this anywhere and it'll go over well with whomever.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/985947">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />06 - Luke's Anger "Yo Ass" Bowwow 05 [Dead Like Elvis Ep 2006]<br />This EP has future classic written all over it. Of course that's just me being cheeky with my markers, but it's for good reason. I can't even really describe the overall sound of the EP. it's got so much variety crammed into 4 tracks it should be made into the National Anthem for one of the smallish countries.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/679554">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />07  - Blackmass Plastics "Gatesmasher" Bowwow 06 [Quarantine Zone EP 2007]<br />Blackmass is a new found artist for me. Someone forgot to keep me in the loop a few years back for about 10 minutes and it resulted in me missing out on some gold. Big up the Uk badness this guy represents. I love it and want more.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/965772">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />08 - Fix "Dope Computer" KMS 43 [Flash EP 1992]<br />I think we all know this record. By ear at any rate. Now you know what it is, if you didn't already. Classic tune on the flip, but Dope Computer is just as good and doesn't get as much air time. Changed that!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/4649">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />09 - Smooky "Fresh (Feat. Nino-Fight, MC Coeld'r, Dj Idem)" Electronik Weed Crew 07 [Do You Remembmer Ep 2007]<br />A lot of nerds went on saying this EP wasn't as good as previous Smooky/EWC material. Sure it may be a change of pace for them, but if you want to get all nasty every time someone tries something a tad different than I suggest eating something long and cumbersome. Ho! It's great fun, who doesn't like Swedish Mc'ing on top of a Kool and the Gang's remix of "Fresh"? <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/981524">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />10 - Jacob London "The Casino Squirrels and Lounge Shooter" Utensil 19 [Droppin Squirrels EP 2007]<br />I actually played the wrong song on this EP, but I figured it was too late to turn back. It's still good of course. Anyone who's live-sets involve singing into a vocoder stuffed into a monkey's anus can't go too wrong.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/952351">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />11 - The Wee Djs "Kick it VIP" Combat Recordings 10 [Darkhorse Dubs Ep 2006]<br />Another Wee track. I'm a big Wee fan. The low end, whether it's distorted or not, is always done proper. The little extra squiggly bleeps are what do my head in though. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/837034">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />12 - Daze Maxim "Unknown" White<br />The one sheet that came with this has fallen out. I believe it's Serial killer's Haircut 31, but since the info has been lost I can't be sure. I should have markered it on like the rest I know. Ok. I'm 98% sure this is SKH 01. Confirmation so I can write it on the damn record already?<br /><br />13 - Blackmass Plastics "Freak House" Rag & Bone 11 [Four Aces Ep 2006]<br />Yadda Yadda BMP. Right after I heard the Bowwow Ep I did some digging for any other BMP I might like. The problem was I couldn't find one I didn't like and this was the only other one in stock. My eyes are peeled now.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/602564">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />14 - Jason Leach "Untitled" Input-Output 11 [Beateater EP 2005]<br />Cynthia Stern's label is currently one of my favorites. Top 5 for sure. It's likely to stay there for a while too. I could see him messing it all up by suddenly only releasing Germanic Polka mash-ups or something. Great label + Jason Leach = Holy trouser trout! The long chiptune/breabeat gem on the flip is what I usually play the snot out of, I thought I'd try this side out today. Sounds like I should have checked it out sooner.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/601281">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />15 - Youngman & Landstrumm "Double Bag It" Input-Output 09 [Destroyaz EP 2005]<br />The Destroyaz they call themselves when touring together and that's exactly what they do. A certified legend and another one in the making?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/384532">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />16 - Joy Division "She's Lost Control (Neil Landstrumm Cover Version)" Scandinavia 25 [Factory Revival Ep 2006]<br />When Neil takes hold of the reins and vocals are involved he seems to get better and better. I can't remember an instance of it not being awesome, but it improves every time as well. This one was a project that sat close to home for him, influential music from his early music beginnings.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/678334">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />17 - Caucasian Boy "Honey Dip (Prime Cutz Mix)" Strictly Rhythm 12201 [HoneyDip/Northern Lights EP 1993]<br />There's always room for acid. This is a bit of an oldie that may not sit well with some. I would even be tempted to say it's a bit of a light weight these days. I was in the mood for it though so what I can say?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/31561">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />18 - Lambda "Hold On Tight (Laidback Luke Remix)" La Maison Grande [Hold On Tight LP 1999]<br />I first heard the original mix of this played by Barry Weaver back in the 90's sometime. I didn't know what it was at the time, but it stuck in my head. I was thoroughly stoked when I was skimming through new releases one day and discovered not only what it was, but that it was also being repressed. I love those happy occurences!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/134603">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br />19 - DadaBleep "Nikeshirts" RZ Music 20 [Nikeshirts EP 2007]<br />RZ rocks out again with another record that could have been written 15 years ago, but wasn't.A new take on the classic acid sound. Always welcome in my home. It reminds me of another record that was big about 2 years ago. And now for the life of me I can't remember just what the hell that other record is. I'll ponder some more...<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/988496">Discog's link w/ more info...</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e66%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-05-2007.mp3">Download the July 5th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Track-list:<br />00 - 3d!t "Bleep Intro"<br />I still giggle at this damn thing.<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">More info...</a><br /><br />01 - The Don "The Horn Song" Strictly Rhythm [The Horn Song EP 1998]<br />Choon! A relatively recent acquaintance of mine loves this song. I found out last week. So this first tune is for Danielle of <a href="http://myspace.com/blubuni">Blubuni</a>.  Virtually all of Pierre's stuff is good music, but this is definitely one of his personal best.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/72517">More info...</a><br /><br />02 - Blake Baxter "Energizer" Tresor 97 [Tresor 3 LP 2000]<br />Another old Detroit gem. I've been on a bit of a motor city rampage lately. Digging up a lot of old stuff and buying a few new ones. Detroit is sorta where I started off so I guess it's only likely I detour through my old haunt from time to time.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/9010">More info...</a><br /><br />03 - Mark Seven "Gonz Gets F.U." Rotation 98011 [Dancefloor Techniques Volume 1 EP 1998]<br />I don't quite recall how I discovered Mark Seven, but I'm glad I did. Out of his half dozen or so EPs there is only 1 I only have 1 copy of. The man knows Techno and Funk like I know my navel and junk. This EP in particular is known to anyone who has heard Dave Angel's "39 Flavours of Tech Funk" mix CD. I think 3 of the 4 tracks are featured on it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/4984">More info...</a><br /><br />04 - TSR "The 7th Otto Odie 7th Otto" HorSpielMusik 44 [Transexual Swiss Rebels EP 2004]<br />TSR are definitely one of my favorite acts right now. Those three nerds do no wrong. Mostly because their wrong is so right. I'm lucky enough to get all kinds of random tracks and remixes from them and let me tell you, the stuff they actually release is great, but they're sitting on gold as well. Brats! The Ep Sleeve says that this record was only Robi and Fredi...I guess Tomi sat this one out. Still smells like Teen Spirit to me though.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/346823">More info...</a><br /><br />05 - Subhead "Unknown" Subhead 02 [Forest Friends EP 1996]<br />One of the best Subhead records to date. I dare you to challenge me on that one. This isn't even the track the EP is known for. I thought I'd give that one a rest. I find the first couple Subhead records (on their label) are crazy good and then it kinda tapers off in the middle of the catalog only to pick up again around 13 or 14...I guess it's good that "tapers off" for Subhead means it's still better than 90% of the Techno out there. They've got that going for them...<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/54857">More info...</a><br /><br />06 - Lief Ryan "Royale Battle" Iron Oxide 04 [Las Vegas Of The North EP 2005]<br />I completely forgot about this record. I've had it for 2 years apparently and this month is the first time I've put it in my bag to play out. The only reason I rediscovered it is because of my girlfriend. She put on a CD with this track mixed in it. I probably made the CD the week I got the record...It took me a while to figure out what it was again, but I'm glad I did. Lief rocked it hard for Iron Oxide!<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/579297">More info...</a><br /><br />07 - Outsider "Sex is Extra (No Assembly Firm's .Dotbleep Re-Edit)" Junior Boy's Own 12 [Sex is Extra EP 2006]<br />This is one of those tasty Chicago House records that's come out recently that I can't seem to put down. It grabs people's attention and works well with most anything else I've ever thrown into it. According to Sylvia, my girlfriend it has the three things that go into a perfect track: Bass, Tweak and Vox. I can't refute that.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/795689">More info...</a><br /><br />08 - Wyndell Long "Chapped Lips" Peacefrog 50 [She Heard Me Cry EP 1996]<br />Wyndell Long is awesome. Techno, House, Booty...whatever he does. Solid production. Solid understanding of a track. Knows how to jack. This is an older one I first heard played by Terry Mullan. There's another old Wyndell on Peacefrog as well, but it's a more Deep house oriented number. I still recommend it though.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/4511">More info...</a><br /><br />09 - Frankie Bones "Unknown" Last Label 01 [(Pro)File. (Pro)Duce EP 2004]<br />I got this from Frankie back before it came out. I had just made a record order through him and he ended up throwing in 3-4 extras into the box. This was one of them. It's a great rework of DHS' "House of God". <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/349083">More info...</a><br /><br />10 - Neil Landstrumm "Help Me" Music Man 98 [Asphyxia EP 2002]<br />Neil on point. The Bassline does my head in. The flipside with The Horrorist is catchy as hell as well in a sort of haunting chant kinda way. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/117800">More info...</a><br /><br />11 - Infiniti "Skyway" Tresor 105 [Skynet: The Infiniti Colection LP 1998]<br />I started the mix off with a track I know Danielle of Blubuni likes and now I toss a track in that I know Eric of Blubuni likes. It's a great track. proof they know their music. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/14106">More info...</a><br /><br />12 - Kenny Larkin "Catatonic (Carl Craig Mix)" R&amp;S Records 94058 [Catatonic Mixes EP 1994]<br /><br />I don't think this song can be truly apreciated in a mp3 mix. It needs to be felt as well as heard. The low end in this one does something to you on a good system. The morphing bass and clanks don't stop moving and they funnel your energy so very well...Gold star!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/7018">More info...</a><br /><br />13 - Luke Hess "Omniscient (Falko Brocksieper Remix)" Beretta Grey 03 [Absolute Truth EP 2007]<br />I don't know who this is. I was given this record at a gig. It's forgettable almost entirely. The Falko mix however sparks it up. It's his tracky nature shining through I think. That and his more 'full' sounding production. Takes it about 3 notches past the original.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/981702">More info...</a><br /><br />14 - Massi DL "Minimal Mushrooms" Frankie Records 18 [1UP EP 2007]<br /><br />I like the bloops in this one. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/953794">More info...</a><br /><br />15 - Jeremy P. Caulfield "Hollow Sky" Trapez 21 [The Cities EP 2002]<br />Jeremy is a local boy, although he's moved to Germany. This is one of his earlier releases and to be honest is only 1 of 2 that I've purchased. I think this one is his best. It hits square in the dance floor.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/84090">More info...</a><br /><br />16 - Massi DL "Minimal Mushrooms" Frankie Records 18 [1UP EP 2007]<br /><br />I like the bloops in this one. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/953794">More info...</a><br /><br />17 - Jeremy P. Caulfield "Ripped Backsides" Trapez 21 [The Cities EP 2002]<br />Jeremy is a local boy, although he's moved to Germany. This is one of his earlier releases and to be honest is only 1 of 2 that I've purchased. I think this one is his best. It hits square in the dance floor.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/84090">More info...</a><br /><br />18 - S-max "Limited (S-max Kool Aid Edit)" Overdrive 158 [Limited Remixes EP 2005]<br /><br />S-max is one of the few "minimal" or "tech-house" producers wo I buy without question. This release is a shining example why. It's got the goods in spades. The vocal which comes out almost as an exhalation plus the thin little acid line is enough to satisfy even the hardest of the core. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/512949">More info...</a><br /><br />19 - Unknown<br />I don't know what's up with this EP, even took me a while to find the discogs link since there is so little info on it. It's a great Acid record, but beyond that it's a mystery. It's one of my little scores that have been made. You search through enough of what stores call "Acid house" and eventually you actually find one or two.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/654173">More info...</a><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e64%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2006-21-2007.mp3">Download the June 21st, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>
