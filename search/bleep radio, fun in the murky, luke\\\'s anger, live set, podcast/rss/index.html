	<description><![CDATA[Luke passed me this recording of his a few weeks back. It's a recording of him playing live. The twist is that it's his first attempt at playing live off of the Machinedrum UW solely.<br /><br />"quite happy with some parts of it, a few of the loops and transitions are a bit ropey but it's nice<br />to bang a box once in a while!"<br /><br />Yes Luke, we all enjoy banging a box once in a while.<br /><br />I hope you all enjoy this mix of Luke's as much as I did. It flows a lot differently than his stuff usually does due to the new way of putting it together for him. It's like hearing all your favorite Luke's Anger tracks remixed and recombined in a new way with some surprises along the way.<br /><br /><br />Also, to celebrate Luke's CD Release I'll be giving away a free copy to the first 3 people who send me an e-mail telling me two pieces of information...<br /><br />1. What Luke's real name is. After all "Luke's Anger" is only his alias!<br />2. What was the first track Luke's Anger had pressed to vinyl?<br /><br />Deadline is next Thursday's Bleep Radio show so get your answer in by then.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e143%20-%20Lukes%20Anger%20-%2001-08-2008.mp3">Download The January th, 2009 Archive</a> ]]></description>
