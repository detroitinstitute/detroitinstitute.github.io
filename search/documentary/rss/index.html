	<description><![CDATA[These are sets from the Hi-Tek Soul event from this year's WMC.<br /><br />The Hi-Tek Soul event is Derrick Mayâ€™s signature event that is based on the documentary film â€œHigh Tech Soulâ€ that depicts the creation of Techno music in the late 80â€™s. Before there was house music, raves, trance and progressive, all dance music was called techno. That was because that style of dance music was never heard of until Derrick May, Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson got together and started making techno music. The Hi-Tek Soul event has been a hit all around the world from San Francisco to Japan. Just last month Hi-Tek Soul made its big London premier at the worldâ€™s most famous nightclub, Londonâ€™s Ministry of Sound.<br /><br />The Hi-Tek Soul WMC party will truly be one of the most unforgettable events of WMC-07. The lineup is truly unique; the DJâ€™s are legends that have made an incredible contribution to the electronic music scene, and now you can get a front row seat to see them perform in an intimate and beautiful 500 person venue.<br /><br />DERRICK MAY, one of the most respected DJâ€™s in the world, also known as the â€œGodfather of Technoâ€ has been given credit to creating the techno genre along with Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson. His label Transmat had its first release â€œX-Rayâ€ back in 1986, a techy and electro-esque track that still today can rock any club across the globe. Derrickâ€™s aggressive mixing style and energy is very unique and his sets cannot be duplicated by any DJ, even if you gave them his track list.<br /><br />KEVIN SAUNDERSON, respected and acknowledged around the World as one of the three Detroit Techno innovators, Kevin Saunderson is a legend in his own right, who has helped to reshape the future of Dance music as we know it! He is hyperactive and loves making hyperactive music. Sometimes it is 'HARD AS HELL TECHNO' with a bassline from some disturbed parallel universe, and sometimes it's joyous gospel house. During 2006 we will celebrate 20 years of Kevin Saunderson's music Productions, Kevin Saunderson/Elevator World Tour- The tour can feature both House and Techno DJ sets incorporating all Kevin's most popular productions from 1985-2006.<br /><br />Derrick May @ Hi Tek Soul WMC Miami 21-03-2007 (disputed)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/pt/?d=ZF61XUYR">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />Stacey Pullen @ Hi Tek Soul Miami Pearl WMC 21-03-2007<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/en/?d=L3CG5NCK">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />Kevin Saunderson @ Hi Tek Soul Miami Pearl WMC 21-03-2007<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/pt/?d=F92C93QQ">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />Interviews from WMC @ RBOM on XM80 04-05-2007<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/pt/?d=7BRYOF05">Download mp3 from megaupload</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[I found this <a href="http://symbiostic.de/downloads/TresorClosing_online.wmv">video of Richie Hawtin's set from Tresor's closing party</a> but then the <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Awakenings_10_Year_Anniversary_47-48/">Awakenings</a> <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Awakenings_10_Year_Anniversary_462007/">sets</a> took over for a few days.  It's about 20 minutes of a pretty good performance cutting between clean recording and live video audio and he's even wearing the "Magda Make the Tea" t-shirt that we <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Magda-at-Lobby-Colombia/">alluded </a> to before.  It seemed like it was much more a party mood compared to the last <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/One-last-FOCUS-Electronic-12-years-farewell-to-Alternative-Take/">Focus:Electronic</a>.  The club had a good run from 1991 to 2005 becoming one of the world's top techno clubs not to mention a fine record label.  The club was located in part of an old department store near the Berlin Wall with a steel vault inside from which came the name, tresor meaning "treasure" in French but in German means "safe" or "vault".  Though a drug raid at the club preceded its closing, economic pressure in the gentrifying neighborhood is what caused the block it sat on to be redeveloped as offices.  And so it goes.  Read the <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/news/Tresor_closing_letter/">closing letter from Tresor here</a>.<br /><br />I also recently watched the Slices's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPioneers-Electronic-Music-Vol-1%2Fdp%2FB000JUBBDQ%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Ddvd%26qid%3D1177017092%26sr%3D1-1&tag=detrinstoft06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Pioneers of Electronic Music Volume 1 DVD</a>,  which is basically a documentary about Richie Hawtin.  It contains lots of interview footage of <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Richie-Hawtin-at-Winter-Music-Conference/">Richie Hawtin</a>, <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Magda-at-Lobby-Colombia/">Magda</a>, <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/John_Acquaviva_April_podcast/">John Acquaviva</a>, the Hawtin family, <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Sven-Vath-Saturday/">Sven Vath</a><a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/One-last-FOCUS-Electronic-12-years-farewell-to-Alternative-Take/">Clark Warner</a>, Derrick May, and so many other important people in the Detroit techno scene.  Lots of footage from his early days in Detroit, the beginnings of Plus 8 Records, and lots of goodies and extras in general.  It's sure to become a classic in techno history if only because there are so few documentaries that tell the story right now, the other great new one being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHigh-Tech-Soul-Creation-Techno%2Fdp%2FB000GCFYOY%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1177017092%26sr%3D1-1&tag=detrinstoft06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">High Tech Soul</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPioneers-Electronic-Music-Vol-1%2Fdp%2FB000JUBBDQ%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Ddvd%26qid%3D1177017092%26sr%3D1-1&tag=detrinstoft06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325"> Purchase Pioneers of Electronic Music Volume 1 DVD here</a>.  <br /><br /><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=detrinstoft06-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> ]]></description>
