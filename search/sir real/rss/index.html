	<description><![CDATA[After a few months off, Noodle return with the phattest line up to date. <br />Bring on the bass! <br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />Noodle with Warlock & Sir Real <br />Saturday 13th June <br /><br />Warlock (Rag & Bone Records) <br />Sir Real ([k]rack-troni[k] / House of God) <br />Craig Sylvester <br />Ally Reilly <br />Mark Allen <br />Matt Hinton <br /><br />8pm-4am <br /><br />Moog, Newdigate Street, Nottingham NG7 4FD <br /><br />FREE ENTRY as always! <br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />A DJ refusing to be sucked into any one genre, a typical Warlock set is a new experience every time. <br /><br />A spontaneous mash up of all things dark and bass heavy but above all, big tunes. Expect anything from the contemporary flavas of dubstep, electro, breaks and 4x4 to old skool hardcore, acid house and techno. <br /><br />Beginning his days on legendary London pirate Pulse FM, Warlock was a regular feature on the rave circuit, resident at Labrynth, Helter Skelter and up and down the country playing the likes of The Eclipse, Elevation, Interdance and Universe. <br /><br />He then became a part of the early London techno scene and would often be found spinning at Knowledge, Eurobeat 2000 and many of the early squat parties put on by Spiral Tribe and Bedlam. <br /><br />Today, together with Noyeahno, he runs the uncompromising Rag & Bone label which aside from their own releases has seen cult material being unleashed by the likes of Aaron Spectre, Drop The Lime, King Cannibal, Kanji Kinetic and Blackmass Plastics. <br /><br />Expect dirty dancefloor business all the way. <br /><br />Sir Real (Neil Spragg) has been involved in the music scene in Birmingham, UK for more than 20 years as a drummer, producer and label-owner, and for the last fifteen years, following an eye-opening visit to Holland, he has been an integral part of the Midlands club scene and is one of the three original resident DJs (alongside Surgeon & Paul 'Damage' Bailey) from notorious Birmingham club House of God, one of the longest running techno clubs in the UK (it recently celebrated its 15th birthday!). Sir Real has DJ'd and played live extensively around the UK, as well as in clubs across Europe, and in Japan. He is also a prolific producer, and released several well-received EPs on the now-defunct Round Records (which he helped set up in 1997). He has his own label Snafu Recordings, and helps run Covert Records with DJ Bigfoot. <br /><br />Most recently energy has been directed towards [k]racktroni[k], which focuses on broken elektro funk. He has also recorded tracks for Satamile, Ant-Zen/Hymen, Psy-Harmonics, Domino, Embryo Records, Magic Trax, and Melt Recordings and has had several tracks licensed to high profile compilations (including Dave Clarke's hugely successful World Service electro-techno mashup and Bentley Rhythm Ace's FSUK mix). <br />On top of all this he also manages to hold down a full-time job as head of sales at Veto Music Wholesale, a distribution company based in the Midlands, and still finds time to fit in the odd sound-design contract for various gaming companies in the UK. <br /><br />Noodle are excited to welcome him to Nottingham for a set of electro and party techno. Expect it to go off. <br /><br />See you on the dancefloor! <br /><br /><br /> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<img src=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_Vb40tZkuST0/ScIjlXQAa1I/AAAAAAAAAQQ/PXSSQ9V7tp0/s400/cloutier.JPG><br /><br /><a href=http://fairtilizer.com/tracks/26266/download><b>mnml ssg #22 : eric cloutier</a></b><br /><br />and the hits keep on coming... following on from cio's lovely mix, the latest edition in the mnml ssgs mx series comes from NYC's eric cloutier. eric was someone who we came across last year, i think it may have been a mix he did for the ghostly 'cast that grabbed our attention. that combined with him tending to make comments we agree with was enough for us to think that he'd make a fine addition to the series. unsurprisingly, eric has stepped up to the plate and delivered an impressive mix which shows a deft touch on the decks. it has taken a bit longer than expected for eric to come up with the mix, as he kept mindfucking himself in the process, but it was definitely worth the wait. he explained to me that, 'before i wasn't letting myself come through and was putting too much pressure on myself, but when it came down to it, relaxing and just going with what i know and feel yielded a mix that i'm exceptionally proud to share with ssgs and its audience.' and he certainly should feel proud. this one is a beauty.<br /><br />eric puts on a monthly night in new york called 'down', which is every third thursday at oulu lounge in brooklyn. here is his discription of it: 'always free, guests here and there. almost never breaking 120bpm. it was basically created out of my own personal desire to hear something outside of the normal dancefloor affair, as well finally use some music that i've owned and adored for years that i never get to play.' sounds like pretty good logic to me. you can find more info about eric at <a href=http://www.myspace.com/elementeight><b>his myspace</b></a> and <a href=http://www.elementeight.net><b>his webpage</a></b>.<br /><br />big thanks to eric for really digging deep on this mix. as everyone knows, we have a distinct concept and purpose with this series and we are always very happy when the contributor fully signs up to what we are trying to do. so much respect to eric. get excited and for now, enjoy the carefully crafted sounds of eric cloutier. <br />=========================================================<br /><br />00. potuznik - the traveler turned around [cheap records]<br />01. audion - i am the car [unknown]<br />02. dub taylor - human shades #18 [opossum recordings]<br />03. gonno - i don't need competition [beyond]<br />04. pepe bradock - deep burnt [kif recordings]<br />05. seth troxler - aphrika [wolf+lamb records]<br />06. derek marin - bright lights, dark room (osborn remix) [subtrak]<br />07. omar-s - psychotic photosynthesis [fxhe records]<br />08. pied plat - double trouble [rush hour]<br />09. mathias mayer + patlac - skipper [liebe*detail]<br />10. pan-pot - ape shall never kill ape (cassy remix) [mobilee]<br />11. steve bug + richie hawtin - low blow [m_nus]<br />12. the vision - detroit: one circle [metroplex]<br />13. scott grooves - atmospheric emotions [natural midi]<br />14. levon vincent - these games [novel sounds]<br />15. jeremy - #10 b1 [driftwood] ]]></description>

UK Bass originator Paul Blackford is joined by some of the scenes future stars including fellow Bass Gun operator, Smashback and the Data Trace Records collective. <br /><br />Since it's inception over four years ago, Manchester's Electrode event has gone on to acclaim an international reputation as as the kind of event that offers fresh, cutting edge, dancefloor based electronic music with an atmosphere that most nights could only wish for. <br /><br />Their music policy draws on many elements including electro, techno, breakbeat, dubstep and acid. Past guests have included:- Si Begg, Tim Wright, Bill Youngman, Ardisson, Ade Fenton, Lief Ryan, Cynthia Stern, Cutlass Supreme, Sir Real, Dark Mode, Warlock, NoYeahNo and Stormfield to name but a few. <br /><br />The Noodle story is similar, coming into existence just over 2 years ago and quickly acquiring a reputation for quality underground beats. The only place in Nottingham that you can hear Detroit Electro-bass alongside Swedish wonkyness! Guests have included DMX Krew, Cynthia Stern, MLZ, Lief Ryan, Luke's Anger, Peter Mangalore, Spewis and Computer Controlled. <br /><br />With the more recent success of labels Data-Trace and Bass Gun, spawned off the back of Electrode and now holding their own amongst the most repected and <br />established labels around, the collective's reputation and respect continually grows. <br /><br />********************<br />coach travel from Nottingham.

	<description><![CDATA[00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />Ed, you're a nerd.<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Edit's Website</a><br /><br />01 - Cristian Vogel "Ninja" Tresor 35 [Sirius LP 1995]<br /><br />This track of Cris' has always been a pain in my backside. I love it, but can never find much to play with it. To this day I've never found 1 other record or track that I can say I really think meshes well with it. It makes me curse and sweat. Although the sweat may just be the heat right now.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/44356">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />02 - Chris Sattinger "Joy Etc." Subvoice 10 [The mumbler Ep 1997]<br />Chris Sattinger, AKA Mono Ekagra, Timeblind, Keek and a few others has always been a hell of a producer. All the stuff he put out on the Mid-west acid labels and Probe was awesome. Even his dubstep stuff these days is pretty rocking. This is the record that contains the track "Fun in the Murky". Do I have to tell you what that means or can ya'll figure it out?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/113245">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />03 - Aeox "She's Gotta Gun" Mental Ind. 02 [Paranoid EP 2001]<br /><br />This is by far the biggest most bad ass Techno track you'll ever hear. Aeox at their prime. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/98513">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />04 - Blackmass Plastics "Beatings" Rag &amp; Bone 11 [Four Aces Ep 2006]<br />Kick step you way on over and enjoy blackmass with me. As mentioned the last few shows in a row: I'm newly hooked on BMP. can anyone recommend some of his older releases to me? Something I should check out for sure.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/602564">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />05 - Queaver &amp; Versis "Dr. Pest" Error 04 [De Nischel Ep 2006]<br /><br />Q&amp;V are usually hiding on a b-side somewhere with only one track to their name on a comp. This time however, they've got, well, the b-side again, but at least this time they got the whole damn side! I'm a huge fan of their newest track on Kugelbox 5. "..and I hate to cook!" The half time breakdown made <a href="http://www.fukhouse.ca">fukhouse</a> get silly.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/839068">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />06 - Dj Funk "Funk U Up (Dj Rush Berlin Mix)!" Pro-Jex 54 [Funk U Up! Ep 2004]<br />I bought this EP for the Begg mix, but ended up liking the Rush Berlin mix better once it was in my posession. Go figure, I'm not really a Rush fan at all, but there are some gems and gold bits strewn throughout his prolific career.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/223085">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />07 -  Aeox "2:0" Neue Heimat 32 [Easy Jetset EP 2007]<br />This is possibly the last Aeox Ep we'll ever see unfortunately. Both Hanno and Alex have parted to work on other things. In theory what this means is more releases from the two of them. Not as Aeox, but hey I'll take what I can get.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/935843">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />08 - Nino Fight "Ca Flotte (Jason Leach Slight Remix)" Mercurochrome 06 [Patate Fight EP ]<br />I don't know if anyone else considers this a classic joint, but I sure do. it's got "I still remember it and it's 10 years later" written all over it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/301388">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />09 - RV "Kill Me" Bombtrap 04 [Bombsplit 1 EP 2006]<br />I was playing the flip side to this for awhile, but only just realized that I hadn't really given RV's two track on this side much of a chance. Zing...it's good too. I really need to buy less vinyl so that I can fully appreciate what I do have in a timely manner.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/797341">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />10 - Sueme &amp; Total Useful "RDA" Input-Output 14 [Motorboy EP 2006]<br />I love this Ep and am glad that I sent Sueme to Cynthia at I-O (Mr. braggery runs amok!) when he was looking for a home for it. Sueme as some of you know used to be half of Subhead and Total useful is a Japanese lad if my memory serves me correct. Phil went on about him, but now I've forgotten it all. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/989550">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />11 - Subhead "Unknown" Subhead 14 [14 EP 1998]<br />At my local record store -- when I had one -- I was known as the guy who bought the weird stuff. Suited me just fine, but one day the owner got this record in. I don't think I had too much Subhead at this point. Maybe one other Ep and I'd seen them live in Toronto once around this time too. Point to that was..I bet you it was this EP that sent me round the bend and had me looking past the Detroit and more for the Real Techno.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/61962">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />12 - Paul Birken "Fender Bender" Tonewrecker 12 [Junk Profanity EP 2006]<br />Fender Bender is dirty. So very dirty. Paul should be outlawed. The very least...tar and feather him! Seriously bad ass...acidgrungecoretootyfruitybassno<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/883378">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />13 - Sutekh "Shiura" Belief Systems 04 [Deadpan Escarpment LP 1998]<br />Near the end of the 90's was when I was on my "minimal" kick. That was when I started buying up the Sutekh, Twerk and Kit Clayton stuff. I thought it was awesome (still do!), but then a few years went by and I noticed that there was more and more coming out. And less and less of it was worth buying. Fast forward to 2007. The situation hasn't improved. I can't stand 99.9% of whatcomes out in the "minimal" bins these days. Why can't Sutekh come back to his former glory? Seth...give us one last romp in the woods.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/8777">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />14 - Elec Pt. 1 "Unknown" Bunker 3067 [Dangerous For The Environment EP 2007]<br />Unh Unh. Acid, Cologne style yo. I don't know about Dangerous for the Environment, but it's mucking up the needles real good.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/967424">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />15 - Debo "World War 3" Dance Mania 214 [A Lil Somethiin-Somethin EP ]<br />I don't know who Debo is, but I can say that it was a Toronto Dj who first played this and hooked me on it. Vortex was in the house!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/138913">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />16 - Traxmen "Let Me See You Butterfly" Dance Mania 68 [Basement Traxx Vol 2 EP 1994]<br />Traxmen rocked. This Ep however, has a secret weapon on it. "Indoor use Only" will force that grin on your face to record proportions.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/1585">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />17 - Luke's Anger "Method To Madness" Tiger Bass 02 [Give Em Some Freq Ep 2007]<br />I shouldn't even say anything about this EP or Luke. I've been going on about him so much it's getting stupid now. Oh well. Luke rocks. Deal with it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/945493">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e67%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-12-2007.mp3">Download the July 12th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>
