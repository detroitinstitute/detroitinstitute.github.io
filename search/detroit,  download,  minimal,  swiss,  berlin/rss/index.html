	<description><![CDATA[Recently releasing on Carl Craig's Planet E, Switzerland's Ripperton was featured on last week's Resident Advisor podcast with 75 minutes of serious minimal techno that hits all the right frequencies.  Recorded in secret, this mix features many new tracks as well as some unreleased ones.<br /><br />This week on the RA podcast is a mix by the mysterious Redshape.
