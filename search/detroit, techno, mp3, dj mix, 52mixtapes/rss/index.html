BC/RS have been one of my biggest influences in both techno and the listening process. to let the sound take over the senses and have those excursions of air be the only stimuli is an indulgence that needs to be experienced by everyone.  In my opinion, Morwitz von Oswald and Mark Ernestus were a head of the game.  They were, not only, big influences to detroit/techno artists (such as carl craig, richie hawtin, monolake, kevin saunderson, maurizio, villalobos, deep chord, echochord, etc.); the "shenanigans" done by this german-based label outfit also influenced and helped introduce the audio components and aesthetics now heard in contemporary, experimental sonic outputs from mates on the other side of the pond like, the bug (techno animal), shackleton, peverlist, pinch, appleblim, 2562, burial, deadbeat, and pole, to name a few.  innovators on their own plane..  I present 52mixtape012 to the people of Basic Channel.  <br />  <br />tracks were taking from numerous Basic Channel and Rhythm and Sound albums and eps including other tracks and remixes by monolake, carl craig, paperclip people, sleeparchive and richie hawtin.<br /><br />respect,<br />m. ]]></description>
