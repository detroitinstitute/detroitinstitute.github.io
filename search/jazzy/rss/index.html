	<description><![CDATA[October's <a href="http://www.homewithhouse.com">Home with House</a> episode is finally here. This month's mix is a loungy ride suitable for listening to while hanging around the house or perhaps when having a dinner party. It contains equal parts soulful, funky, jazzy, and deep house all while maintaining that lounging vibe. There are moments of relaxed groove, some upbeat and funky sections and a few deeper tracks to keep things interesting.<br /><br />This mix is a bit unusual for the Home with House podcast series because it has broken away from the 1 or 2 hour mix target. I originally intended to make this a single hour mix but I ran over that time because I was in the flow of the mix. It also happened to fall short of the 2 hour mark because I didn't feel like shoe-horning songs in to stretch it out. So this mix is truly a result of just following the flow. I hope you enjoy episode 23, this one is called "The House that Lounge Built".<br /><br /><img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh23_thumb.jpg" border="0"><br /><br />"The House that Lounge Built" tracklisting:<br /><br />1.

	<description><![CDATA[I've been listening to a lot of Mark Farina's Mushroom Jazz CDs lately, especially volumes 4, 5 and 6. So it should be no surprise that this month's Home with House episode is strongly influenced by those mixes. This episode is still strictly house music, but it definitely has a more chilled and loungy vibe to it. I've entitled episode 19 "Just Be" because of its laissez-faire mood and relaxed energy. I hope you enjoy the mellow groove. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh19_thumb.jpg" border="0"><br /><br />"Just Be" tracklisting:<br />1. Joe Rizla - Donna Di Mondo (Dub Pass Mix)<br />2. Jon Cutler feat. E-man - It's Yours (Frankie Feliciano's Reconstruction Mix)<br />3. Tamara Wellons - Oh Well (Bahsonik Beats Mix)<br />4. Joey Youngman - My First Love (Original Mix)<br />5. Abstract Jazz Lounge 2 - Straight Magic (Wamdue Kids Jazz Mix)<br />6. Aya - Sean (Eric's 2WFU)<br />7. Oriental Funk Stew - Sweet Emotion (OFS Smooth Operation Mix)<br />8. Helskanki ft Bliss & Tihanna - Passers By (Ben Jam Funky Dub)<br />9. DJ Wady - Mozambu (Johnny Fiasco Mix)<br />10. Martello - U R The Reason (Disko Junkie Dub Mix)<br />11. Olivier Desmet & Oriental Funk Stew - Hot On Your Trail (Frequent Fliers Remix)<br />12. Rasmus Faber feat.

	<description><![CDATA[Last month's Home with House episode had a mellow late night groove, but this month's mix is much more energetic. Similar to episode 10, this mix is all about the funk.

So give'er a listen and I hope you enjoy!<br /><br /><img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh17_thumb.jpg" border="0"><br /><br /><b>Mr. FunkHouser tracklisting:</b><br />1.

	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh16_thumb.jpg" width="192" height="192" border="0"><br /><br />So I'm a big fan of jazz. I like all sorts of jazz. From smooth and soulful, to funky and jamming, all the way to deep and atmospheric, I like my jazz. I also like house music, with a similar breadth and assortment of tastes. So it should be no surprise that I love jazzy house music. You can probably hear hints of jazzy flavour throughout many of my mixes, and some are even themed around that style. This episode of the Home with House podcast definitely is.<br /><br />So take a listen and enjoy this journey through jazzy house. Home with House episode 16 is the first 2 hour mix of 2009 and it's appropriately called Midnight Jazz.

  <source url="http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thefreshpage.com%2Fhousemusic%2FAaronBradley-TheFreshpageSessions5.ram"><![CDATA[TheFreshPage Sessions V]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[There are few dj's who work as hard as Aaron Bradley to push their skills and take the art of dj'ing to he next level.<br /><br />With several highly popular mixes already released on TheFreshpage it was only natural to ask Aaron Bradley to create an exclusive mix for us. TheFreshpage Sessions 5 takes on a new twist shying away from electro house and brings you the warmth of funky deep house music. With that said you definitely need to prepare yourself for getting your freak on as the cover of this release is not the only thing that's going to give you tingles down your spine! Deep basslines carries the groove from the get go and transforms to the jazzy rhythms of Chuck Love's Learn to Love. But things get a little f-r-e-a-k-y with Peace Division's It's Here It's Now only to come back with the acid jazz flavour of the following tracks La thomberia and Hula Hula. But Aaron saves one of the best for the last part of the set, Joey Youngman's Heatwave Jackin which is so hot it might just heat up your ear lobes. With impeccable mixing and funky track after funky track Aaron Bradley sheds a new light on TheFreshpage Sessions. ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[If you like it funky and deep then Aaron Bradley has something for you! The Funky Deep End has a cool calm and collected feel perfect for the transition between spring and summer. With chill vocals like in Pimp and jazzy saxophone melodies in Do it Again you're going to have a hard time not letting loose of all of that daily tear and wear on your spirit. Tribal injected drumlines are interspersed wtih soulful vocals right up near the end with a standout track Crazy Times by Toka Project vs Da Sunlounge. ]]></description>
