	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i45.tinypic.com/2hwnyfa.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />The plateaus of dense electrical fields foster the creative insurgency that’s necessary to occupy the attention of the worlds musical soldiers and the correspondence you’d exchange with yourself would dissolve into an acknowledgment of attachment.  It’s these audible depth charges that rattle your consciousness and in turn give you a fresh vista on your own progress, something our guest this week incites facilely.  He’s still harvesting the success of last year’s release ‘Shaman’s Path’ and rightly so – it was one of the albums of the year for us.  During the course of the production sequence which has facilitated the furtherance on Prologue, he’s maintained a heavy club and festival schedule across Europe.<br /><br />We dropped the touring confirmation at the start of the month – Dino Sabatini will be commencing his assault on Australia in March.  We’re lining up the first show in Brisbane with the White Rhino crew.  Anomaly in Sydney are fronting up the following night at One22 and closing the tour will be Billion Underground’s showing on March 08 in Melbourne.  This addition to the mix series is an apt sequel to an evolving saga – the rolling drugged electronica mirrors the events that will transpire.<br /> ]]></description>
