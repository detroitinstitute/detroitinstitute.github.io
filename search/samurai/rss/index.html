	<description><![CDATA[Poker Flat, Steve Bug's minimal tech-house label from Berlin, has been showcasing many of its artists over at Samurai.FM.  The latest in the Poker Flat Presents series is Poker Flat Presents Mike Vamp.  Frankfurter turned Berliner Mike Vamp had a past in the drum&bass scene early on but since turned to techno, releasing on another of Steve Bug's labels, Raw Elements, and other labels like Studio !K7 (think DJ Kicks).<br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.samurai.fm/player/play.php?id=1990&t=audio&m=wmp&s=0">Stream</a><br /><a href="http://rapidshare.com/files/53217289/Poker_Flat_Presents_Mike_Vamp_02.09.2007.mp3.html">Download mp3 from rapidshare</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Tonight I want to feature two mixes by Santiago Salazar, a.k.a. DJ S2, of Los Hermanos of Underground Resistance.  The first is his new mix for Chroma Collective's show "Interstate-94", which is the famous freeway that goes west from Port Huron and goes through Ann Arbor, Kalamazoo, Milwaukee, and Minneapolis but more importantly is the main road (after replacing Michigan Ave/US-12) connecting Detroit and Chicago, techno and house.  The track list follows and, as you can see, contains many unreleased tracks by himself and others.<br /><br />01. Ican - El Sereno - Ican Productions *<br />02. Kerri Chandler - Oblivion - Soul Heaven<br />03. Trackheadz - Our Music - NRK<br />04. Ican - Si Se Puede(Album Version) - Ican Productions<br />05. Thought Criminal - The Machine - Plan Recordings<br />06. Drumcell - Brain Wreck - Droid Recordings<br />07. Studio X - Los Kings Del Mambo - N Fusion<br />08. Esteban Adame - Maravilla13 - Ican Productions*<br />09. Diego - Pillow Rocker - Kanzleramt<br />10. Santiago Salazar - Plastic People - Ican Productions*<br />11. Robert Hood - Still Hear - Music Man<br />12. Teste - The Wipe - Probe Records<br />13. Roy Ayers - Tarzan (Ã‚me Mix) cd-r<br />14. Quince - Americana - Delsin<br />15. Ican - Nite Owls - Ican Productions*<br />16. Ican - Northend (dedicated to Submerge) - Ican Productions*<br /><br />*unreleased<br /><br /><a href="http://www.bassaholicsanonymous.com/mp3/I-94_March_07_MIX.mp3">Download mp3</a><br /><br />Total time 54:51<br /><br />The second mix is from last year on Samurai FM for the Conexion show which starts off with Santiago's track Cambio.  One of my favorite tracks, perhaps it's the Roy Ayers sample from Golden Rod.  Unreleased at the time, it was eventually released under his Ican alter ego on Planet E. Following the Santiago set is a set by DJ Dex done for Underground Gallery in Japan.  If you like this set and you're comfortable with Japanese you can <a href="http://www.undergroundgallery.jp/shop/shop.cgi?order=&class=all&keyword=Recommend&FF=0&price_sort=&mode=p_wide&id=2171&superkey=1">purchase it here</a>.<a href="http://www.undergroundgallery.jp/realaudio/SUGCD-002-2.ram">Listen to more samples of UR061- Invisible Show Case Vol. 01 Part Two here.</a><br /><br />Track list of DJ Dex portion heard on the show:<br />...<br />05. Portable â€œThe World Unwindsâ€<br />06. DJ 3000 â€œTales of Persiaâ€<br />07. Los Hermanos â€œOlmec my Broâ€<br />08. Nomadico â€œPlanetaâ€<br />09.

  <source url="http%3A%2F%2Fwww.samurai.fm%2Fdissonanze2006%2F"><![CDATA[Sven Vath Saturday]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[Here's a set by the German Godfather of Techno to get you in the party mood this Saturday night.  Superstar DJ, label boss, producer, and proprietor of two successful nightclubs in Germany, he comes from a trance background but has since come around to the techno side of things, running the gamut of our favored genre.<br /><br />Here's what Samurai FM has to say: German DJ/musician Sven Vath is truly one of the driving forces behind European dance electronic music since the late 80s. As a DJ, his legendary marathon sets have received acclaim around the world. In addition, Vath creates his own innovative music: Vath's albums like "Accident in Paradise" and "The Harlekin, The Robot, & The Ballet Dancer" are landmarks of contemporary electronic music. "Contact", which includes the heralded cut Your Sweat "is a bridge between the eighties and now" says Vath. In the meantime, his labels, Harthouse and Cocoon, has been responsible for unleashing many highly creative artists, including Speedy J, Legowelt, Anthony Rother, Ricardo Villalobos, Funk'd'void, Steve Bug, Zombie Nation. His Cocoon club in Frankfurt and Cocoon night at Amnesia in Ibiza are among the hottest spots in the world, legendary places where people dance for hours to boost their own energies. And his Coccon agency is now one of the most active in the world. Expect a deep experience!<br /><br />Enjoy this recent set recorded on Big City Beats on Big FM and another via Samurai FM recorded at last year's Dissonanze.<br /><br /><a href="http://mixing.hu/mix/2007/march/14/Sven_Vath_-_Live_@_Big_City_Beats_On_Big.Fm_-_11-Mar-2007_www.mixing.hu.mp3">Download mp3 of Big City Beats</a><br /><a href="http://www.samurai.fm/player/play.php?id=1805&t=audio&m=real&s=1<br />">Listen to Dissonanze set at Samurai FM</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA["Dave Clarke is probably one of the most important techno and electro producer DJs around. His cut up DJ sets are the stuff of legend, where the dancefloor is constantly kept on the edge as electro, techno, Chicago jack house, booty bass and leftfield sonics are spliced and diced with razor-sharp precision. His seminal productions which stream back to 1989 include the Red Series, early output for his own Magnetic North imprint, â€˜Compassâ€™, â€˜Way of Lifeâ€™ and more recent albums such as â€˜Devilâ€™s Advocateâ€™ and â€˜Archive Oneâ€™."<br /><br />Thanks to <a href="http://www.samurai.fm">samurai.fm</a> for the introduction and the streaming set.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.samurai.fm/player/play.php?id=2311&t=audio&m=real&s=1">Stream</a><br /><br />Total time 1:00:03 ]]></description>
