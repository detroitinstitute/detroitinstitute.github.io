	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.electronique.it/uploaded/Podcast/detroit_web.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />Right after listening to his mix I fully understood the artist’s  choice to appear anonymously.<br /><br />The city of Detroit is experiencing perhaps one of the darkest moments in its history.<br />There is no need for heroes, main characters, the urgent need is the salvation of body and soul.<br /><br />Our man in Detroit has felt on his skin the rise and decline of the city, and knows every single aspect in depth. The choice is clear, putting  in the foreground music, salvation, introducing the city through its musical history. A rich history, no doubt about it.<br /><br />The City Observer Statement<br /><br />Here we go folks...<br /><br />Thanks to electronique for asking me to do this mix.<br />I thus decided to remain uncloaked cause i'm here to fully represent the Music of Detroit in the best way i can, not myself.<br /><br />Being born in Detroit, I consider myself lucky since I've been exposed to all the best music coming from the city since i was a child, you know, Motown, and jazz, rock and funk, got loads of records from my family and friends, so they were the starting point of the mix. <br />Did a small tribute to the founding fathers of house and techno and electro too, without them the D would not be on the map... till the sound of now.<br /><br />Going back with memory is also very personal and emotive task, since Detroit is facing a very hard time now. City is near bankruptcy, all the remaining people, mostly black, is becoming poorer and poorer.<br />The decline is not a new thing as you may know, the town suffers from unemployment, abandonement and poverty, since decades.<br /><br />Crack and guns are corrupting our new generations..<br /><br />But in this desolation, I feel the strenght of my people who still live here. Their souls are alive. The wonderful thing about my city is that people keeps believing and making music out of desperation, to paint a better future for them and their children to keep them out of the streets.<br />This positive attitude is a beautiful thing that no crisis will ever delete.<br />My mix is dedicated to this people, who keep things going even in the harder times.<br /><br />peace-<br /><br />R.I.P. James, Aaron-Carl, Ron, Ken<br /><br />Ladies and gentlemen, The City Observer plays Detroit City! ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[October's <a href="http://www.homewithhouse.com">Home with House</a> episode is finally here. This month's mix is a loungy ride suitable for listening to while hanging around the house or perhaps when having a dinner party. It contains equal parts soulful, funky, jazzy, and deep house all while maintaining that lounging vibe. There are moments of relaxed groove, some upbeat and funky sections and a few deeper tracks to keep things interesting.<br /><br />This mix is a bit unusual for the Home with House podcast series because it has broken away from the 1 or 2 hour mix target. I originally intended to make this a single hour mix but I ran over that time because I was in the flow of the mix. It also happened to fall short of the 2 hour mark because I didn't feel like shoe-horning songs in to stretch it out. So this mix is truly a result of just following the flow. I hope you enjoy episode 23, this one is called "The House that Lounge Built".<br /><br /><img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh23_thumb.jpg" border="0"><br /><br />"The House that Lounge Built" tracklisting:<br /><br />1.

	<description><![CDATA[Resident Advisor RA.145 DJ Koze - 2009.03.09<br /><br /><img src="http://i44.tinypic.com/jkblab.jpg" height=100><br /><br />Stefan Kozalla thinks outside of the box on this weekâ€™s RA podcast.<br />If youâ€™ve been listening to techno in the past decade, the name of DJ Koze has most likely been inescapable. But it was 2008 that took him to an even higher level: Last yearâ€™s â€œLetâ€™s Loveâ€/â€I Want to Sleepâ€ single on International Records Recordings took the top spot on RAâ€™s year-end poll.<br />The remix, however, has long been Kozallaâ€™s forte, with memorable readjustments of Heiko Voss, Sid Le Roc and Ben Watt all featuring on his upcoming remix collection, entitled Reincarnations, but his DJing has been just as heralded. Heâ€™ll be doing the latter at next monthâ€™s Time Warp party in Mannheim amongst a line-up of technoâ€™s elite, but donâ€™t expect a set of the latest dance floor anthems.<br />â€œI prefer it when the music becomes slower and sexier the longer the night gets,â€ said Kozalla when speaking to RAâ€™s Eike KÃ¼hl late last year, and thatâ€™s exactly what heâ€™s done on this weekâ€™s RA podcast. We caught up with the man by e-mail to talk about the mix, record shopping and his new label. <br /><br />Tracklisting<br />Mount Kimbie â€“ William â€“ Hotflush<br />Soulphiction â€“ Whatâ€™s Your Name - Musik Krause<br />Moodymann - Freeki MF - KDJ<br />NSI - Hassel - Cadenza<br />Lowtec - I Remember - Playhouse<br />Syncom Data - Beyond The Stars (Speedy J Remix) - SD<br />Ben Klock - OK - Ostgut Ton<br />Modi and Fegiz - El Solitaire - Vinylclub<br />The Missing Link - 911 - Wagon Repair<br />Lazy Fat People - Low Profile - Perspectiv Records<br />AntonZap - Pm Please - Underground Quality<br />Fail Forever - When Saints Go Machine (dOP Remix) - EMI<br />Lowtec - Workshop 006 - Workshop<br />Animal Collective - My Girls - Domino Recording Company<br /><br /><a href="http://ra2.residentadvisor.net/audio/RA145_20090309_DJ-Koze-residentadvisor.net.mp3">Download mp3</a> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Fabrice Lig, aka Soul Designer, is 100% Detroit despite being Belgian.  He understands the classic Detroit techno style well enough to try to represent it in a single track called "Detroit Sound" he released as Soul Designer and he was notably the first outsider, a white European, to release on one of the Detroit techno labels from the classic era, Kevin Saunderson's KMS.  Of course, F. Lig has released on many other labels as well including F Com, Motech with DJ 3000, 7th City, and <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Sven-Vath-Saturday/">Sven Vath</a>'s Cocoon.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.soultronik.be/audio/fabricelig_impress_leuven_wwwgroovy-clubbe.mp3">Download mp3</a> ]]></description>

The beat sets up<br />extreme pressure - deeply pumping! The introducing bass creates an nameless groove with<br />great harmonics.  A tiny squeaky synth behaves like a ball lightning and adds a particular<br />charm to the track. The producers are rolling out such an extraordinary carpet of sound that<br />the eight-minute arrangement is over too quick and you want to enjoy again and again. Great<br />track - full of emotion and warm atmosphere - far in the front and at home at any dance floor -<br />every time and everywhere!<br /><br />A2: Simplicity Always Wins"  You are going completely wrong if you would like to judge<br />the track from its name. You could think that the name is suitable in the beginning - hearing<br />the airy low-groove beat. Next step you get in touch with the constant bass and the forcing up<br />synths and effects and realize that the guys attached importance to extreme sonic quality.<br />A few elements merge and create a complex environment which you will listen in repeat mode until<br />you experienced every single bit. It's a ticket for a rich in content vacation at the Monoid universe!<br /><br />B1.: Meridian  B-Side surprise - extraordinary dance floor bomb.  Contrasts attract each<br />other - celebration par excellence! The beat pushes and agitates the feet on the dance floor.<br />The harmonic bass supported by the creamy and clear chords and ambience bursts the firm<br />atmosphere and you can hardly describe the created mood. This track provides a state of<br />emergency! Headbanger with strong emotions - must listen!<br /><br />B2.: Leaving is a special rounding up the broad range of moods on this EP. Tribal techno<br />meets tech-house - sounds easy  and housy but is pushing forward like techno.<br />Filtered guitar chords drip from the sweat-saturated ceiling. ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[Remixes of Michigan native Heartthrob's "Baby Kate" were released on M_nus this month but technical problems on their server prevented fans from listening to them online.  That has been fixed.  The 12â€œ features four remixers with an additional three available for purchase as MP3s.  <a href="http://www.residentadvisor.net/feature-read.aspx?id=799">Resident Advisor interviewed Heartthrob</a> several weeks ago and asked about Baby Kate.  Apparently, it's named after Kate Moss.  While Kate has appeared in music videos for the White Stripes, Johnny Cash, and in a song titled "Kowalski" (no relation to the makers of yummy kielbasa), we have heard no news that she will be in any video for this.<br /><br /><a href="http://m-nus.com:8000/content/CA-M26-07-50008.mp3.m3u">Magda's "Where's My Baby's Daddy?"
