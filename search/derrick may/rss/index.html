	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i49.tinypic.com/15ezki1.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />RYC Podcast 009 | Raffaele Attanasio (Napels)<br /><br />Raffaele Attanasio was born in a family of musicians. He cultivated a passion for music since he has been a child, infact he started to have piano lessons. At the age of 12 he started to take ones first steps in the world of djing and after 5 years he made his first productions. In this period he was really into techno music, electronic music and classical-contemporary composition. In 2007 he took the piano graduation which improves his artistic language. Raffaele Attanasio is a pianist, arranger and producer. During his career he collaborated with artists such as Orlando Voorn for the personal compilation on Nightvision Records. Now he is supported by important artists such as Len Faki, Luke Slater, Ben Sims, Kirk Degiorgio, Chris Liebing, Marcel Dettmann, Ben Klock, Juan Atkins, Derrick May, Oscar mulero and Dustin Zahn. Raffaele made remixes for Trapez, Gynoid and the last is called Telrae for Reimut Van Bonn. At the moment his success Black Bloc Ep (NON 001, 2011) is on charts. It's the first output on the spanish label. It's about a work made up of solid and snare techno groove. It's also going to come out the remixes version (NON002, 2012). The artist has choosen Italy as his home. Raffaele wishes one day the public will be less xenofile because it should be proud of italians talents and don't make them live the "Bel Paese". European artists should be less envious of italians.<br />Raffaele Attanasio is the proof of italians success. ]]></description>

For that you can refer to previous Bleeps. I will mention again that it'll probably be a long time before it leaves my bag so get used to hearing it. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/985947">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[05:33] 02 - Luke's Anger "Organ Monkey" Tigerbass 02 [Give Em Some Freq EP 2007]<br />Again I'm always going on about Luke's stuff. I've spoiled him enough. I'll relate a quick story instead. last Saturday my girlfriend and I went to the drive-in. Sitiing in the car, in line, waiting to pay, I was listening to this mix. At the point this track came on the car beside us gave us strange looks. I didn't say it was a good story...<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/945493">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[08:35] 03 - Sugar Experiment Station "Influence Technology" Scandinavia 03 [Ultimathule EP 1996]<br /><br />All four tracks on this EP should be drilled into people's head the very second they are born. Unless it's discovered that loud music is bad for newborns. I suspect it may be. it's classic in my circles and I suspect other's as well. Neil Landstrumm and Tobias Schmidt work together well now and seemingly always have. Although to be fair I didn't have to think that up myself. neil says so in his <a href="http://www.scandinavianyc.com/nickedidea.html">Archives</a><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/17554">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[11:50] 04 -  Tobias Schmidt "Systemshocker" Feinwerk 11 [Heavy Makeup EP 2007]<br />Another track, from another record, that wont be soon leaving the bag. Toby has been absolutely killing it the last few releases. he's always been someone I kept an eye out for, but it's reached a new level. It all started with the Monkey Tennis EP. Something changed. For the better.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/861897">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[15:48] 05 - Axel Sohns "Analog Komplex" Tonewrecker 11 [Circling The Wagons Ep 2006]<br /><br />I don't know if Axel has anything else lined up for release. I do know his label Kitty-Corner is putting out some killer releases though. I definitely urge everyone to check out the latest ep by TSR.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/883378">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[19:08] 06 - Lief Ryan "Da Shit!" Growth 02 [Unhealthy Living EP 2003]<br />I seem to have a strange relationship with Lief's stuff. I get it, love it, forget about it. Don't know why. Lately I've been digging back out and giving it the room to breathe and the playtime it deserves.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/213851">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[22:11] 07 - Rosie Brown "Bliss (D's Boom Bap Bleep Edition)" .dotbleep 11 [Bliss - Derrick Carter Remixes EP 2006]<br /><br />I firmly believe this track is being abused by myself. And yet I can't put it away. DC's magic touch has overwhelmed my senses with his cunning use of bleep and vocal!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/764184">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[26:40] 08 - Jamie Lidell "Freely Freekin" Mosquito 08 [Freekin The Frame EP 1997]<br />I've come to the conclusion that this is probably my favorite track. Most people start off sucking at least a little. jamie started off where most end up and has only gotten better since this record. Big up the TSR boys for hooking me up with this so I can have a 2nd copy. Not to hog it, but to be able to play the snot out of it without worrying about ruining my only copy!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/21253">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[29:58] 09 - Byron Stingily "Get Up! (Mousse T.'s Extended Mix)" Peppermint Jam [Get Up! Remixes EP 1996]<br /><br />This record is one of the few I catch myself singing along to. Brings me back to early party days and more specifically old Terry Mullan sets.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/50838">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[33:31] 10 - TSR "Robi Und Fredi" Don't 09 [Onion Tied To My Belt EP 2006]<br />I'm going to go out on a limb and say that only two of the TSR'ers were involved in this track. They finally got rid of that Tommy character!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/635266">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[36:07] 11 - Smash TV "Electronic Boy" Bpitch Control 20 [Rock On Boy Ep 2001]<br /><br />This was one of those songs that you hear out and go nuts trying to figure out what it was. I believe it was Mateo Murphy that finally id'd it for me that year. Via...the old Gtech mailing list. yes my memory is very selective, but quite often very good.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/39709">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[40:14] 12 - Luke's Anger "Strangle Hold" Don't 10 [Fistful Of Donkeys EP 2006]<br />Blah blah blah...see above. I do have this to say about the next Don't release though..."Readyyy now....." Sing it Frankie! ;) Tip!!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/722426">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[43:31] 13 - Subhead "Forest Friends" Subhead 02 [Forest Friends Ep 1996]<br /><br />Subhead of course being quite good at what they do did it again on the 2nd release of their own label. This is the track that most people buy it for if I do remember idle chat correctly. The release party for this EP was big news at the time and apparently was 5 shades of awesome. Subhead live and Claude Young when the music he played was still good? Yes please.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/54857">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[47:04] 14 - Tomas Nordstrom "Jagermiester" Don't 05 [Knights Of The Jager EP 2004]<br />This is a new addition to the bag, but it's been around the block. I made myself put it away for a while as I over played it big time when it first came out. I'm allowing myself to use it again. Sparingly. if I overdo it...suck it up.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/324535">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[50:22] 15 - Mark Hawkins "Frequency Respnose" Input-Output 15 [13 Years Of Raving EP 2007]<br /><br />Think of this as a teaser EP. It's not really. Not officially I don't think anyway. Mark's album worth of tracks that he WANTS A HOME FOR is all along the same vein as this ep. There's one difference....The LP is even better. It's got Bill Youngman and aLXe doing guest bits on it. Previews soon my pretties<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/912169">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[54:53] 16 - Cannibal Cooking Club "longpigchef (Bill Youngman Remix)" Cannibal Cooking Club 04 [Recooked Volume 1 EP 2005]<br />This is probably one of my favorite remixed tracks. Bill totally turned a decent CCC track into gold. A guy I work with who doesn't normally listen to anything electronic heard this on a cd I had. he was fist pumping within seconds. Uh..in the air.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/455990">Discog's link w/ more information...</a><br /><br />[57:32] 17 - Kylie Minogue "Slow (Tomas Nordstrom Feat. Chill Cover Version)" <br /><br />I had to include this track. I tossed it in at the very end as I believe it deserves a full play out. I wont bother telling you all just how much I love it. I'll let you decide for yourself just how damn catchy it is.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e69%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-26-2007.mp3">Download the July 26th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

  <source url="http%3A%2F%2F"><![CDATA[Hi-Tek Soul WMC sets from Derrick May, Stacey Pullen, Kevin Saunderson]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[These are sets from the Hi-Tek Soul event from this year's WMC.<br /><br />The Hi-Tek Soul event is Derrick Mayâ€™s signature event that is based on the documentary film â€œHigh Tech Soulâ€ that depicts the creation of Techno music in the late 80â€™s. Before there was house music, raves, trance and progressive, all dance music was called techno. That was because that style of dance music was never heard of until Derrick May, Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson got together and started making techno music. The Hi-Tek Soul event has been a hit all around the world from San Francisco to Japan. Just last month Hi-Tek Soul made its big London premier at the worldâ€™s most famous nightclub, Londonâ€™s Ministry of Sound.<br /><br />The Hi-Tek Soul WMC party will truly be one of the most unforgettable events of WMC-07. The lineup is truly unique; the DJâ€™s are legends that have made an incredible contribution to the electronic music scene, and now you can get a front row seat to see them perform in an intimate and beautiful 500 person venue.<br /><br />DERRICK MAY, one of the most respected DJâ€™s in the world, also known as the â€œGodfather of Technoâ€ has been given credit to creating the techno genre along with Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson. His label Transmat had its first release â€œX-Rayâ€ back in 1986, a techy and electro-esque track that still today can rock any club across the globe. Derrickâ€™s aggressive mixing style and energy is very unique and his sets cannot be duplicated by any DJ, even if you gave them his track list.<br /><br />KEVIN SAUNDERSON, respected and acknowledged around the World as one of the three Detroit Techno innovators, Kevin Saunderson is a legend in his own right, who has helped to reshape the future of Dance music as we know it! He is hyperactive and loves making hyperactive music. Sometimes it is 'HARD AS HELL TECHNO' with a bassline from some disturbed parallel universe, and sometimes it's joyous gospel house. During 2006 we will celebrate 20 years of Kevin Saunderson's music Productions, Kevin Saunderson/Elevator World Tour- The tour can feature both House and Techno DJ sets incorporating all Kevin's most popular productions from 1985-2006.<br /><br />Derrick May @ Hi Tek Soul WMC Miami 21-03-2007 (disputed)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/pt/?d=ZF61XUYR">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />Stacey Pullen @ Hi Tek Soul Miami Pearl WMC 21-03-2007<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/en/?d=L3CG5NCK">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />Kevin Saunderson @ Hi Tek Soul Miami Pearl WMC 21-03-2007<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/pt/?d=F92C93QQ">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />Interviews from WMC @ RBOM on XM80 04-05-2007<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/pt/?d=7BRYOF05">Download mp3 from megaupload</a> ]]></description>
