	<description><![CDATA[00 - Edit "Bleep Radio Intro"<br />Ed, you're a nerd.<br /><a href="http://www.dirtyspinach.com">Edit's Website</a><br /><br />01 - Cristian Vogel "Ninja" Tresor 35 [Sirius LP 1995]<br /><br />This track of Cris' has always been a pain in my backside. I love it, but can never find much to play with it. To this day I've never found 1 other record or track that I can say I really think meshes well with it. It makes me curse and sweat. Although the sweat may just be the heat right now.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/44356">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />02 - Chris Sattinger "Joy Etc." Subvoice 10 [The mumbler Ep 1997]<br />Chris Sattinger, AKA Mono Ekagra, Timeblind, Keek and a few others has always been a hell of a producer. All the stuff he put out on the Mid-west acid labels and Probe was awesome. Even his dubstep stuff these days is pretty rocking. This is the record that contains the track "Fun in the Murky". Do I have to tell you what that means or can ya'll figure it out?<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/113245">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />03 - Aeox "She's Gotta Gun" Mental Ind. 02 [Paranoid EP 2001]<br /><br />This is by far the biggest most bad ass Techno track you'll ever hear. Aeox at their prime. <br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/98513">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />04 - Blackmass Plastics "Beatings" Rag &amp; Bone 11 [Four Aces Ep 2006]<br />Kick step you way on over and enjoy blackmass with me. As mentioned the last few shows in a row: I'm newly hooked on BMP. can anyone recommend some of his older releases to me? Something I should check out for sure.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/602564">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />05 - Queaver &amp; Versis "Dr. Pest" Error 04 [De Nischel Ep 2006]<br /><br />Q&amp;V are usually hiding on a b-side somewhere with only one track to their name on a comp. This time however, they've got, well, the b-side again, but at least this time they got the whole damn side! I'm a huge fan of their newest track on Kugelbox 5. "..and I hate to cook!" The half time breakdown made <a href="http://www.fukhouse.ca">fukhouse</a> get silly.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/839068">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />06 - Dj Funk "Funk U Up (Dj Rush Berlin Mix)!" Pro-Jex 54 [Funk U Up! Ep 2004]<br />I bought this EP for the Begg mix, but ended up liking the Rush Berlin mix better once it was in my posession. Go figure, I'm not really a Rush fan at all, but there are some gems and gold bits strewn throughout his prolific career.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/223085">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />07 -  Aeox "2:0" Neue Heimat 32 [Easy Jetset EP 2007]<br />This is possibly the last Aeox Ep we'll ever see unfortunately. Both Hanno and Alex have parted to work on other things. In theory what this means is more releases from the two of them. Not as Aeox, but hey I'll take what I can get.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/935843">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />08 - Nino Fight "Ca Flotte (Jason Leach Slight Remix)" Mercurochrome 06 [Patate Fight EP ]<br />I don't know if anyone else considers this a classic joint, but I sure do. it's got "I still remember it and it's 10 years later" written all over it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/301388">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />09 - RV "Kill Me" Bombtrap 04 [Bombsplit 1 EP 2006]<br />I was playing the flip side to this for awhile, but only just realized that I hadn't really given RV's two track on this side much of a chance. Zing...it's good too. I really need to buy less vinyl so that I can fully appreciate what I do have in a timely manner.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/797341">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />10 - Sueme &amp; Total Useful "RDA" Input-Output 14 [Motorboy EP 2006]<br />I love this Ep and am glad that I sent Sueme to Cynthia at I-O (Mr. braggery runs amok!) when he was looking for a home for it. Sueme as some of you know used to be half of Subhead and Total useful is a Japanese lad if my memory serves me correct. Phil went on about him, but now I've forgotten it all. <br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/989550">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />11 - Subhead "Unknown" Subhead 14 [14 EP 1998]<br />At my local record store -- when I had one -- I was known as the guy who bought the weird stuff. Suited me just fine, but one day the owner got this record in. I don't think I had too much Subhead at this point. Maybe one other Ep and I'd seen them live in Toronto once around this time too. Point to that was..I bet you it was this EP that sent me round the bend and had me looking past the Detroit and more for the Real Techno.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/61962">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />12 - Paul Birken "Fender Bender" Tonewrecker 12 [Junk Profanity EP 2006]<br />Fender Bender is dirty. So very dirty. Paul should be outlawed. The very least...tar and feather him! Seriously bad ass...acidgrungecoretootyfruitybassno<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/883378">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />13 - Sutekh "Shiura" Belief Systems 04 [Deadpan Escarpment LP 1998]<br />Near the end of the 90's was when I was on my "minimal" kick. That was when I started buying up the Sutekh, Twerk and Kit Clayton stuff. I thought it was awesome (still do!), but then a few years went by and I noticed that there was more and more coming out. And less and less of it was worth buying. Fast forward to 2007. The situation hasn't improved. I can't stand 99.9% of whatcomes out in the "minimal" bins these days. Why can't Sutekh come back to his former glory? Seth...give us one last romp in the woods.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/8777">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />14 - Elec Pt. 1 "Unknown" Bunker 3067 [Dangerous For The Environment EP 2007]<br />Unh Unh. Acid, Cologne style yo. I don't know about Dangerous for the Environment, but it's mucking up the needles real good.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/967424">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />15 - Debo "World War 3" Dance Mania 214 [A Lil Somethiin-Somethin EP ]<br />I don't know who Debo is, but I can say that it was a Toronto Dj who first played this and hooked me on it. Vortex was in the house!<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/138913">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />16 - Traxmen "Let Me See You Butterfly" Dance Mania 68 [Basement Traxx Vol 2 EP 1994]<br />Traxmen rocked. This Ep however, has a secret weapon on it. "Indoor use Only" will force that grin on your face to record proportions.<br /><br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/1585">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br />17 - Luke's Anger "Method To Madness" Tiger Bass 02 [Give Em Some Freq Ep 2007]<br />I shouldn't even say anything about this EP or Luke. I've been going on about him so much it's getting stupid now. Oh well. Luke rocks. Deal with it.<br /><a href="http://www.discogs.com/release/945493">Discogs link w. more info...</a><br /><br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e67%20-%20Trevor%20Wilkes%20-%2007-12-2007.mp3">Download the July 12th, 2007 Archive</a> ]]></description>

  <source url="http%3A%2F%2F"><![CDATA[Bleep 57 with tafkatafta]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[New Bleep yesterday, <a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/mt/2007/05/bleep_57_tafkatafta.html">number 57</a> with non-DJ tafkatafta.<br /><br />"I asked tafkatafta if he'd like to put together a show for Bleep. I didn't really know what to expect, but I knew it'd be good. As far as I'm concerned Alex can do no wrong.<br /><br />The show he gave me is not mixed. Alex doesn't DJ. It's also not a Live-set, but it is a smattering of released and un-released tracks of his some played out and some just faded into the next. He also 'interviewed' Bill Youngman in a Berlin park for the show (very serious topics!) and played an older track of Bill's that has never been released.<br /><br />I personally feel this is one of the best Bleep's to date. Maybe I have more of an emotional attachment than any of you would have, regardless the effort Alex put into this is appreciated to the utmost and I hope someone hears his stuff who ordinarily wouldn't have.<br /><br /><br />T.he A.rtist F.ormerly K.nown A.s T.he A.rtist F.or T.he A.rtists = tafkatafta which is one of the aliases belonging to Alexander KÃ¶pke of Berlin, Germany. <br /><br />Alex also use the following names: L.x.A., Al.X.E and tafkatafta. Alex was formerly a member of Aeox which incidentally is how I discovered him and his music.<br /><br />Alex currently runsZinch Records and has several websites with his own music on them for download. tafkatafta.de and nietzschelieder.de. I highly recommend visiting the tafkatafta site as there are 60 tracks for download, covering a huge range of styles. I find his stuff reminds me of Art of Noise. It's not a direct mapping by any means, I'm just reminded of AoN whenever I listen to Alex's material."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e57%20-%20tafkatafta%20-%2005-03-2007.mp3">Download mp3</a><br /><br />Total time 1:01:25<br /><br />Approximate track list:<br /><br />00:00 - tafkatafta "??" un-released<br />04:30 - tafkatafta "??" un-released<br />09:46 - tafkatafta "Clixx" Zinch 3<br />18:20 - Al.X.E "Scheiss Techno" unreleased<br />21:51 - Al.X.E "Up" un-released [Available for download, here.]<br />25:00 - Alex & Bill in the park<br />30:27 - Bill Youngman "??" unreleased<br />33:40 - Mark Hawkins Featuring Al.X.e "Go With The Flow" Feinwerk (forthcoming)<br />38:00 - "??" arty rehearsal room shit!<br />41:14 - L.x.A.

  <source url=""><![CDATA[Tresor closing video and Richie Hawtin documentary]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[I found this <a href="http://symbiostic.de/downloads/TresorClosing_online.wmv">video of Richie Hawtin's set from Tresor's closing party</a> but then the <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Awakenings_10_Year_Anniversary_47-48/">Awakenings</a> <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Awakenings_10_Year_Anniversary_462007/">sets</a> took over for a few days.  It's about 20 minutes of a pretty good performance cutting between clean recording and live video audio and he's even wearing the "Magda Make the Tea" t-shirt that we <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Magda-at-Lobby-Colombia/">alluded </a> to before.  It seemed like it was much more a party mood compared to the last <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/One-last-FOCUS-Electronic-12-years-farewell-to-Alternative-Take/">Focus:Electronic</a>.  The club had a good run from 1991 to 2005 becoming one of the world's top techno clubs not to mention a fine record label.  The club was located in part of an old department store near the Berlin Wall with a steel vault inside from which came the name, tresor meaning "treasure" in French but in German means "safe" or "vault".  Though a drug raid at the club preceded its closing, economic pressure in the gentrifying neighborhood is what caused the block it sat on to be redeveloped as offices.  And so it goes.  Read the <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/news/Tresor_closing_letter/">closing letter from Tresor here</a>.<br /><br />I also recently watched the Slices's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPioneers-Electronic-Music-Vol-1%2Fdp%2FB000JUBBDQ%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Ddvd%26qid%3D1177017092%26sr%3D1-1&tag=detrinstoft06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">Pioneers of Electronic Music Volume 1 DVD</a>,  which is basically a documentary about Richie Hawtin.  It contains lots of interview footage of <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Richie-Hawtin-at-Winter-Music-Conference/">Richie Hawtin</a>, <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Magda-at-Lobby-Colombia/">Magda</a>, <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/John_Acquaviva_April_podcast/">John Acquaviva</a>, the Hawtin family, <a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/Sven-Vath-Saturday/">Sven Vath</a><a href="http://www.detroitinstitute.org/techno/One-last-FOCUS-Electronic-12-years-farewell-to-Alternative-Take/">Clark Warner</a>, Derrick May, and so many other important people in the Detroit techno scene.  Lots of footage from his early days in Detroit, the beginnings of Plus 8 Records, and lots of goodies and extras in general.  It's sure to become a classic in techno history if only because there are so few documentaries that tell the story right now, the other great new one being <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FHigh-Tech-Soul-Creation-Techno%2Fdp%2FB000GCFYOY%3Fie%3DUTF8%26qid%3D1177017092%26sr%3D1-1&tag=detrinstoft06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325">High Tech Soul</a>. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/redirect.html?ie=UTF8&location=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.amazon.com%2FPioneers-Electronic-Music-Vol-1%2Fdp%2FB000JUBBDQ%3Fie%3DUTF8%26s%3Ddvd%26qid%3D1177017092%26sr%3D1-1&tag=detrinstoft06-20&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325"> Purchase Pioneers of Electronic Music Volume 1 DVD here</a>.  <br /><br /><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=detrinstoft06-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[We hereby disclose that on 16 April 2005 Tresor Club will celebrate the last party in its Leipzigerstrasse location.<br /><br />The property landlord Bauwert Development Delta GmbH & Co. has amiably allowed this last extended time limit. After that an office structure for the VolksfÃ¼rsorge will be constructed on the premises.<br /><br />We would like to thank everyone, all the artists, co-workers or guests that have, for over 14 years, made this utopia in the heart of Berlin possible. In order to arrange a worthy conclusion, our intention is to invite all the artists that have so clearly left a mark on the club to say loudly â€œgoodbye and see you soon!â€ during the period between 01 â€“ 16 April.<br /><br />For the future we are working to resurrect the Tresor phenomena in a new home location. We welcome any dialog and co-operation with the cityâ€™s decision makers concerning the situation. Tresor would like to proceed and realise its mission to be instrumental in the further development of electronic forms of expression.<br /><br />More information coming soon...<br /><br />With sincere affection,<br />The Tresor Team ]]></description>
