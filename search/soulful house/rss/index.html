	<description><![CDATA[October's <a href="http://www.homewithhouse.com">Home with House</a> episode is finally here. This month's mix is a loungy ride suitable for listening to while hanging around the house or perhaps when having a dinner party. It contains equal parts soulful, funky, jazzy, and deep house all while maintaining that lounging vibe. There are moments of relaxed groove, some upbeat and funky sections and a few deeper tracks to keep things interesting.<br /><br />This mix is a bit unusual for the Home with House podcast series because it has broken away from the 1 or 2 hour mix target. I originally intended to make this a single hour mix but I ran over that time because I was in the flow of the mix. It also happened to fall short of the 2 hour mark because I didn't feel like shoe-horning songs in to stretch it out. So this mix is truly a result of just following the flow. I hope you enjoy episode 23, this one is called "The House that Lounge Built".<br /><br /><img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh23_thumb.jpg" border="0"><br /><br />"The House that Lounge Built" tracklisting:<br /><br />1.

	<description><![CDATA[This month's <a href="http://www.homewithhouse.com">Home with House</a> podcast episode is another mix focusing on the funk.

	<description><![CDATA[Every so often I feel like making an upbeat and primarily vocal DJ mix, and this month's <a href="http://www.homewithhouse.com">Home with House</a> podcast episode is just one of those times. Episode 20 is yet another two hour long mix of funky, upbeat and vocal house mixed with my usual flavour. It starts off relatively mellow and soulful and progressively builds a groove that becomes more upbeat and funky. The mix reaches a crescendo at the end with a couple of big progressive house tracks and then fades out with a vocal denouement to finish it off. As usual with my mixes, this one includes a few older tracks mixed in with mostly newer ones. There is also a tribute track to MJ with a nice unreleased remix of Billy Jean by a fellow deep house junky from South Africa named Erefaan Pearce. I hope you enjoy episode 20, this one is called "Distant Voices". <br /><br /><img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh20_thumb.jpg" border="0"><br /><br />"Distant Voices" tracklisting:<br />1.

	<description><![CDATA[I've been listening to a lot of Mark Farina's Mushroom Jazz CDs lately, especially volumes 4, 5 and 6. So it should be no surprise that this month's Home with House episode is strongly influenced by those mixes. This episode is still strictly house music, but it definitely has a more chilled and loungy vibe to it. I've entitled episode 19 "Just Be" because of its laissez-faire mood and relaxed energy. I hope you enjoy the mellow groove. <br /><br /><img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh19_thumb.jpg" border="0"><br /><br />"Just Be" tracklisting:<br />1.

	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://www.homewithhouse.com/music/hwh16_thumb.jpg" width="192" height="192" border="0"><br /><br />So I'm a big fan of jazz. I like all sorts of jazz. From smooth and soulful, to funky and jamming, all the way to deep and atmospheric, I like my jazz. I also like house music, with a similar breadth and assortment of tastes. So it should be no surprise that I love jazzy house music. You can probably hear hints of jazzy flavour throughout many of my mixes, and some are even themed around that style. This episode of the Home with House podcast definitely is.<br /><br />So take a listen and enjoy this journey through jazzy house. Home with House episode 16 is the first 2 hour mix of 2009 and it's appropriately called Midnight Jazz.
