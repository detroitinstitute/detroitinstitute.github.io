	<description><![CDATA[<img src="http://i46.tinypic.com/1z15rie.jpg" border="0"/></a><br /><br />The 102nd Podcast of my weekly Podcast show Invite's Choice!<br />This week with guest: Giorgio Gigli<br /><br />Starting today, I will be uploading an extra podcast every last Saturday of the month.<br />Besides this mix by Giorgio Gigli, Raffaella Attanasio's electronic sounding podcast will be also be online on my SC page!<br /><br />It's been a while since I first asked Giorgio Gigli for a podcast, but the moment is finally here. He's made a 61 minute trip that stays interesting from the first to last minute and doesn't bore at any time.<br />Often really deep sets have that effect on me as they're to flat, but not so for mr Gigli: he knows what he's doing!<br /><br />What else can I say about this man who has released records on Electric Deluxe, label of Dutch hero Speedy J and where I was fortunate enough to play at Timewarp Holland, Giorgio has played at the Italian edition!<br /><br />It's about time to get to the music; here's Giorgio Gigli's trip for Invite's Choice!<br /><br />Check all Invite's Choice podcasts via: Invite's Choice Podcast section.<br /><br />Next week my Choice will be: Raffaele Attanasio ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[ATOMIC-JAM <br />Saturday 20th March - 9.30PM-6.00AM <br />Q-Club <br />Corporation Street, Birmingham <br /><br />Atomic Jam returns to the Q Club for one of only two planned spectacular shows at this venue in 2010. Luke Slater, one of UK's true electronic music & techno pioneers, presents his Planetary Assault Systems live show. As well as running his own label Mote-evolver, 2009 saw the release of the new and much awaited PAS album on Ostgut Ton in Berlin, again changing the Techno landscape to much praise from fans and industry alike. Frequency 7, a soundclash of styles from Ben Sims and Surgeon, performing together creating a uniquely improvised experience combining elements of techno, funk, dub, house, hip-hop, disco, industrial etc. utilizing turntables, CD decks, FX & all the latest Hardware/Software technology. Redshape's sound sits somewhere between everything in dance music and Redshape's very own imagination. It's not minimal, not maximal and always historically respecting the vibe of Detroit. Repetition is something Redshape works hard to prevent, his live shows morph & develop everytime to never play the same show twice. Residential duties fall to the much talented Mark Broom & Chris Finke, who both have a wealth of releases, remixes and collabs to keep your eyes on this year <br /><br />MAIN ARENA: <br />LUKE SLATER (Planetary Assault Systems LIVE) <br />FREQUENCY 7 (Ben Sims & Surgeon) <br />REDSHAPE live <br />MARK BROOM <br />CHRIS FINKE <br /><br />ROOM TWO: DRUM & BASS / <br />BREAKTHRU VS GRINDHOUSE <br />CALYX <br />PHASE II <br />DAN B <br />PACE <br />REACTION <br />DJ X <br /><br />ROOM THREE: ELECTRO, UK-BASS, RAVEBEATS / <br />RESONANT ALLIANCE <br />The RA collective unite for further sonic experimentation and we're very excited to welcome, from The Hague in Holland, Mr Pauli and DJ Overdose. Two legends of the Dutch electro scene, with links to I-F and releases on the seminal labels Viewlexx, Murder Capital and Bunker, the pair will be performing live followed by DJ Overdose dropping an old-skool electro set. Visual stimulation will be provided by Nottingham party crew On-Site Collective. Do not miss! <br /><br />NOVAMEN live (Mr Pauli + DJ Overdose) <br />Peter Mangalore (Human Shield) <br />See The Road (DJ set) <br />Mazzula (Data Trace) <br />Joel Attack + Wanton Beast (Electrode / Subvert) <br />Mark Allen + Matt Hinton (Noodle) <br />visual stimulation by On-Site Collective <br /><br />Tickets Â£18 <br />Limited earlybird tickets Â£16 from Ticketsellers <br /><br />Birmingham// Swordfish 0121 6334859/ The Ticket Sellers 0121 472 6688/ Atoo 0121 6433989/ Smokin' Vinyl 0121 373 7051 <br />Leamington// Seismic 01926 83133 <br />Manchester// Electrode 07979 408788 <br />Nottingham// Bag'o'Nails 01159 111060 / Alley Cafe 01159 551013 <br />Sheffield// Subvert 07837 574826 <br />Stoke// Load 07846 234441 <br />Worcester// Jingo 01905 723646 <br /><br />Coach travel: <br />Nottingham 07742 355347 <br />Manchester 07979 408788 <br />Sheffield 07999 306862 <br />Stoke 07846 234441 <br /><br />COACH + TICKET PACKAGES AVAILABLE <br /><br />INFO: 07831 325754 VENUE: 0121 212 1212 ATOMICJAM.NET ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[After a few months off, Noodle return with the phattest line up to date. <br />Bring on the bass! <br /><br />//////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />Noodle with Warlock & Sir Real <br />Saturday 13th June <br /><br />Warlock (Rag & Bone Records) <br />Sir Real ([k]rack-troni[k] / House of God) <br />Craig Sylvester <br />Ally Reilly <br />Mark Allen <br />Matt Hinton <br /><br />8pm-4am <br /><br />Moog, Newdigate Street, Nottingham NG7 4FD <br /><br />FREE ENTRY as always! <br /><br />/////////////////////////////////////////////// <br /><br />A DJ refusing to be sucked into any one genre, a typical Warlock set is a new experience every time. <br /><br />A spontaneous mash up of all things dark and bass heavy but above all, big tunes. Expect anything from the contemporary flavas of dubstep, electro, breaks and 4x4 to old skool hardcore, acid house and techno. <br /><br />Beginning his days on legendary London pirate Pulse FM, Warlock was a regular feature on the rave circuit, resident at Labrynth, Helter Skelter and up and down the country playing the likes of The Eclipse, Elevation, Interdance and Universe. <br /><br />He then became a part of the early London techno scene and would often be found spinning at Knowledge, Eurobeat 2000 and many of the early squat parties put on by Spiral Tribe and Bedlam. <br /><br />Today, together with Noyeahno, he runs the uncompromising Rag & Bone label which aside from their own releases has seen cult material being unleashed by the likes of Aaron Spectre, Drop The Lime, King Cannibal, Kanji Kinetic and Blackmass Plastics. <br /><br />Expect dirty dancefloor business all the way. <br /><br />Sir Real (Neil Spragg) has been involved in the music scene in Birmingham, UK for more than 20 years as a drummer, producer and label-owner, and for the last fifteen years, following an eye-opening visit to Holland, he has been an integral part of the Midlands club scene and is one of the three original resident DJs (alongside Surgeon & Paul 'Damage' Bailey) from notorious Birmingham club House of God, one of the longest running techno clubs in the UK (it recently celebrated its 15th birthday!). Sir Real has DJ'd and played live extensively around the UK, as well as in clubs across Europe, and in Japan. He is also a prolific producer, and released several well-received EPs on the now-defunct Round Records (which he helped set up in 1997). He has his own label Snafu Recordings, and helps run Covert Records with DJ Bigfoot. <br /><br />Most recently energy has been directed towards [k]racktroni[k], which focuses on broken elektro funk. He has also recorded tracks for Satamile, Ant-Zen/Hymen, Psy-Harmonics, Domino, Embryo Records, Magic Trax, and Melt Recordings and has had several tracks licensed to high profile compilations (including Dave Clarke's hugely successful World Service electro-techno mashup and Bentley Rhythm Ace's FSUK mix). <br />On top of all this he also manages to hold down a full-time job as head of sales at Veto Music Wholesale, a distribution company based in the Midlands, and still finds time to fit in the odd sound-design contract for various gaming companies in the UK. <br /><br />Noodle are excited to welcome him to Nottingham for a set of electro and party techno. Expect it to go off. <br /><br />See you on the dancefloor! <br /><br /><br /> ]]></description>
