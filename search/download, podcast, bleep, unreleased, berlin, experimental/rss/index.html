	<description><![CDATA[New Bleep yesterday, <a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/mt/2007/05/bleep_57_tafkatafta.html">number 57</a> with non-DJ tafkatafta.<br /><br />"I asked tafkatafta if he'd like to put together a show for Bleep. I didn't really know what to expect, but I knew it'd be good. As far as I'm concerned Alex can do no wrong.<br /><br />The show he gave me is not mixed. Alex doesn't DJ. It's also not a Live-set, but it is a smattering of released and un-released tracks of his some played out and some just faded into the next. He also 'interviewed' Bill Youngman in a Berlin park for the show (very serious topics!) and played an older track of Bill's that has never been released.<br /><br />I personally feel this is one of the best Bleep's to date. Maybe I have more of an emotional attachment than any of you would have, regardless the effort Alex put into this is appreciated to the utmost and I hope someone hears his stuff who ordinarily wouldn't have.<br /><br /><br />T.he A.rtist F.ormerly K.nown A.s T.he A.rtist F.or T.he A.rtists = tafkatafta which is one of the aliases belonging to Alexander KÃ¶pke of Berlin, Germany. <br /><br />Alex also use the following names: L.x.A., Al.X.E and tafkatafta. Alex was formerly a member of Aeox which incidentally is how I discovered him and his music.<br /><br />Alex currently runsZinch Records and has several websites with his own music on them for download. tafkatafta.de and nietzschelieder.de. I highly recommend visiting the tafkatafta site as there are 60 tracks for download, covering a huge range of styles. I find his stuff reminds me of Art of Noise. It's not a direct mapping by any means, I'm just reminded of AoN whenever I listen to Alex's material."<br /><br /><a href="http://www.fun-in-the-murky.com/Bleep_Radio/Bleep%20Radio%20e57%20-%20tafkatafta%20-%2005-03-2007.mp3">Download mp3</a><br /><br />Total time 1:01:25<br /><br />Approximate track list:<br /><br />00:00 - tafkatafta "??" un-released<br />04:30 - tafkatafta "??" un-released<br />09:46 - tafkatafta "Clixx" Zinch 3<br />18:20 - Al.X.E "Scheiss Techno" unreleased<br />21:51 - Al.X.E "Up" un-released [Available for download, here.]<br />25:00 - Alex & Bill in the park<br />30:27 - Bill Youngman "??" unreleased<br />33:40 - Mark Hawkins Featuring Al.X.e "Go With The Flow" Feinwerk (forthcoming)<br />38:00 - "??" arty rehearsal room shit!<br />41:14 - L.x.A.
