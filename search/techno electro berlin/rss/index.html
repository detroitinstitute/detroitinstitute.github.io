	<description><![CDATA[ATOMIC-JAM <br />Saturday 20th March - 9.30PM-6.00AM <br />Q-Club <br />Corporation Street, Birmingham <br /><br />Atomic Jam returns to the Q Club for one of only two planned spectacular shows at this venue in 2010. Luke Slater, one of UK's true electronic music & techno pioneers, presents his Planetary Assault Systems live show. As well as running his own label Mote-evolver, 2009 saw the release of the new and much awaited PAS album on Ostgut Ton in Berlin, again changing the Techno landscape to much praise from fans and industry alike. Frequency 7, a soundclash of styles from Ben Sims and Surgeon, performing together creating a uniquely improvised experience combining elements of techno, funk, dub, house, hip-hop, disco, industrial etc. utilizing turntables, CD decks, FX & all the latest Hardware/Software technology. Redshape's sound sits somewhere between everything in dance music and Redshape's very own imagination. It's not minimal, not maximal and always historically respecting the vibe of Detroit. Repetition is something Redshape works hard to prevent, his live shows morph & develop everytime to never play the same show twice. Residential duties fall to the much talented Mark Broom & Chris Finke, who both have a wealth of releases, remixes and collabs to keep your eyes on this year <br /><br />MAIN ARENA: <br />LUKE SLATER (Planetary Assault Systems LIVE) <br />FREQUENCY 7 (Ben Sims & Surgeon) <br />REDSHAPE live <br />MARK BROOM <br />CHRIS FINKE <br /><br />ROOM TWO: DRUM & BASS / <br />BREAKTHRU VS GRINDHOUSE <br />CALYX <br />PHASE II <br />DAN B <br />PACE <br />REACTION <br />DJ X <br /><br />ROOM THREE: ELECTRO, UK-BASS, RAVEBEATS / <br />RESONANT ALLIANCE <br />The RA collective unite for further sonic experimentation and we're very excited to welcome, from The Hague in Holland, Mr Pauli and DJ Overdose. Two legends of the Dutch electro scene, with links to I-F and releases on the seminal labels Viewlexx, Murder Capital and Bunker, the pair will be performing live followed by DJ Overdose dropping an old-skool electro set.

  <source url="http%3A%2F%2Fwww.samurai.fm%2Fdissonanze2006%2F"><![CDATA[Sven Vath Saturday]]></source>
	<description><![CDATA[Here's a set by the German Godfather of Techno to get you in the party mood this Saturday night.  Superstar DJ, label boss, producer, and proprietor of two successful nightclubs in Germany, he comes from a trance background but has since come around to the techno side of things, running the gamut of our favored genre.<br /><br />Here's what Samurai FM has to say: German DJ/musician Sven Vath is truly one of the driving forces behind European dance electronic music since the late 80s. As a DJ, his legendary marathon sets have received acclaim around the world. In addition, Vath creates his own innovative music: Vath's albums like "Accident in Paradise" and "The Harlekin, The Robot, & The Ballet Dancer" are landmarks of contemporary electronic music. "Contact", which includes the heralded cut Your Sweat "is a bridge between the eighties and now" says Vath. In the meantime, his labels, Harthouse and Cocoon, has been responsible for unleashing many highly creative artists, including Speedy J, Legowelt, Anthony Rother, Ricardo Villalobos, Funk'd'void, Steve Bug, Zombie Nation. His Cocoon club in Frankfurt and Cocoon night at Amnesia in Ibiza are among the hottest spots in the world, legendary places where people dance for hours to boost their own energies. And his Coccon agency is now one of the most active in the world. Expect a deep experience!<br /><br />Enjoy this recent set recorded on Big City Beats on Big FM and another via Samurai FM recorded at last year's Dissonanze.<br /><br /><a href="http://mixing.hu/mix/2007/march/14/Sven_Vath_-_Live_@_Big_City_Beats_On_Big.Fm_-_11-Mar-2007_www.mixing.hu.mp3">Download mp3 of Big City Beats</a><br /><a href="http://www.samurai.fm/player/play.php?id=1805&t=audio&m=real&s=1<br />">Listen to Dissonanze set at Samurai FM</a> ]]></description>
