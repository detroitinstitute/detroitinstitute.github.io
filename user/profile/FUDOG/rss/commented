	<description><![CDATA[Stealth Engineering original line up included artist, Dr Skunkenstein, Heuristic Audio, Delinquent Dialect and Audio Engineer 'Big' Al. Hill. SE was always New Electro, but wanting to move on from the late 90s sound of Electro and evolving a more Techno (dance-floor) sensibility, that and it must be conducted live using modern technology. Which was felt was vastly underused at the time. Bringing the studio into the night club and producing a hybrid sound that ends up neither electro nor techno yet distinctly influenced by both. Before the guys split, only one of their outings was captured and put on the internet, if more exist I do not know. <br /><br />http://www.stealthengine.com/audio/p...t2005_live.mp3 ]]></description>
