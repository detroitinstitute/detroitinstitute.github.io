	<description><![CDATA[These are sets from the Hi-Tek Soul event from this year's WMC.<br /><br />The Hi-Tek Soul event is Derrick Mayâ€™s signature event that is based on the documentary film â€œHigh Tech Soulâ€ that depicts the creation of Techno music in the late 80â€™s. Before there was house music, raves, trance and progressive, all dance music was called techno. That was because that style of dance music was never heard of until Derrick May, Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson got together and started making techno music. The Hi-Tek Soul event has been a hit all around the world from San Francisco to Japan. Just last month Hi-Tek Soul made its big London premier at the worldâ€™s most famous nightclub, Londonâ€™s Ministry of Sound.<br /><br />The Hi-Tek Soul WMC party will truly be one of the most unforgettable events of WMC-07. The lineup is truly unique; the DJâ€™s are legends that have made an incredible contribution to the electronic music scene, and now you can get a front row seat to see them perform in an intimate and beautiful 500 person venue.<br /><br />DERRICK MAY, one of the most respected DJâ€™s in the world, also known as the â€œGodfather of Technoâ€ has been given credit to creating the techno genre along with Juan Atkins and Kevin Saunderson. His label Transmat had its first release â€œX-Rayâ€ back in 1986, a techy and electro-esque track that still today can rock any club across the globe. Derrickâ€™s aggressive mixing style and energy is very unique and his sets cannot be duplicated by any DJ, even if you gave them his track list.<br /><br />KEVIN SAUNDERSON, respected and acknowledged around the World as one of the three Detroit Techno innovators, Kevin Saunderson is a legend in his own right, who has helped to reshape the future of Dance music as we know it! He is hyperactive and loves making hyperactive music. Sometimes it is 'HARD AS HELL TECHNO' with a bassline from some disturbed parallel universe, and sometimes it's joyous gospel house. During 2006 we will celebrate 20 years of Kevin Saunderson's music Productions, Kevin Saunderson/Elevator World Tour- The tour can feature both House and Techno DJ sets incorporating all Kevin's most popular productions from 1985-2006.<br /><br />Derrick May @ Hi Tek Soul WMC Miami 21-03-2007 (disputed)<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/pt/?d=ZF61XUYR">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />Stacey Pullen @ Hi Tek Soul Miami Pearl WMC 21-03-2007<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/en/?d=L3CG5NCK">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />Kevin Saunderson @ Hi Tek Soul Miami Pearl WMC 21-03-2007<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/pt/?d=F92C93QQ">Download mp3 from megaupload</a><br /><br />Interviews from WMC @ RBOM on XM80 04-05-2007<br /><br /><a href="http://www.megaupload.com/pt/?d=7BRYOF05">Download mp3 from megaupload</a> ]]></description>
