The United States has become largely homogenous, the situations all too predictable. The built environment following WWII is almost entirely isomorphic where each building type is hardly distinguishable from the next. With our modernism weâ€™ve stuck everything in a box. Along with all the creativity that has put music and art at the forefront of popular culture, Planning and Architecture in the United States has created one giant suburban hell stretching from ocean to ocean.<br /><br />(sorry some tape drag near the beginning)<br /><br /><a href="http://soundcloud.com/user1682860/detroitologist-future/download">DOWNLOAD SOUNDCLOUD"> ]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[<img src='http://img841.imageshack.us/img841/1419/detroitmetroplex72dpi.jpg' border='0'/></a><br /><br />While Architects and Planners attempt to bring sanity and order to the chaotic city the true magnificence of the city is in it's inherent magnetism... millions of people attracted to miles of streets and cars, the noise of bars and cafes spilling onto the street, hundreds of people crowded together on sidewalks and in subway stations, the air filled with smog and food, the kaleidoscope of shops, the lines of people outside theaters and museums. The city is a stage for the creative and the expressive, a huge broadcast of ideas. The city has often been the core from which the character and culture is built. There is no architecture that can stop this. No planning exists to drain the city and create new life on the outside. The experiment of suburbs could not pull all the people away from their cities. If anything the people polarized into either city or suburb creating this clear division between the two opposing existences. The romantic picture painted by architects and planners of people living in quiet suburbs in utopian autonomy from the city can only be called successful because the people are there. Today the suburbs are the symbol of a life of boredom while the city continues to pulse. The apparent revival of the downtown or the main street is not the result of the propaganda of New Urbanism or some new found economic feasibility. People formed cities ten thousand years ago and have been there ever since. Cities are a part of our basic human design.<br /><br /><a href="http://soundcloud.com/detroitologist/detroitologist-my-detroit-short/download">DOWNLOAD SOUNDCLOUD"> ]]></description>
