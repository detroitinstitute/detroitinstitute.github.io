	<description><![CDATA[Here's a set by the German Godfather of Techno to get you in the party mood this Saturday night.  Superstar DJ, label boss, producer, and proprietor of two successful nightclubs in Germany, he comes from a trance background but has since come around to the techno side of things, running the gamut of our favored genre.<br /><br />Here's what Samurai FM has to say: German DJ/musician Sven Vath is truly one of the driving forces behind European dance electronic music since the late 80s. As a DJ, his legendary marathon sets have received acclaim around the world. In addition, Vath creates his own innovative music: Vath's albums like "Accident in Paradise" and "The Harlekin, The Robot, & The Ballet Dancer" are landmarks of contemporary electronic music. "Contact", which includes the heralded cut Your Sweat "is a bridge between the eighties and now" says Vath. In the meantime, his labels, Harthouse and Cocoon, has been responsible for unleashing many highly creative artists, including Speedy J, Legowelt, Anthony Rother, Ricardo Villalobos, Funk'd'void, Steve Bug, Zombie Nation. His Cocoon club in Frankfurt and Cocoon night at Amnesia in Ibiza are among the hottest spots in the world, legendary places where people dance for hours to boost their own energies. And his Coccon agency is now one of the most active in the world. Expect a deep experience!<br /><br />Enjoy this recent set recorded on Big City Beats on Big FM and another via Samurai FM recorded at last year's Dissonanze.<br /><br /><a href="http://mixing.hu/mix/2007/march/14/Sven_Vath_-_Live_@_Big_City_Beats_On_Big.Fm_-_11-Mar-2007_www.mixing.hu.mp3">Download mp3 of Big City Beats</a><br /><a href="http://www.samurai.fm/player/play.php?id=1805&t=audio&m=real&s=1<br />">Listen to Dissonanze set at Samurai FM</a> ]]></description>
