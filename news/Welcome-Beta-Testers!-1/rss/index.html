	<description><![CDATA[Tomo,

I think I have been having the same problem as dany@ for several months now. I can no longer post anything here. It doesn't matter how long or short the article is. Once I hit the submit button my post disappears as if it had never been entered. I thought I'd wait a few months to see if the bugs got straightened out with the site rework but I'm still having the same problem. I'm using exactly the same template for my posts as I always have but just change the track list portion for each show.

The rub is that several new spam topics were added as I was trying to figure out if I was doing something wrong. It's really bizarre that I can't post a topic that's music related yet the spam bots seem to have no trouble.
