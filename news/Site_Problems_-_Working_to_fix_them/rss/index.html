	<description><![CDATA[Hey Anton, I can't figure out what the problem is (as you are an admin user, although regular users seem to leave spam no problem..) can you leave comments okay?  Can you give me an example of the text that you can't make work?]]></description>

	<description><![CDATA[I'm still having trouble submitting new posts. I go through the process ok and everything looks fine. Once I press the submit button I get taken back to the "Unpublished" page with no trace of the item I had submitted. Is it just me?]]></description>
